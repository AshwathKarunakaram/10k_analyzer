Product revenues increased by 86% from fiscal 2001 to 2002, and 96% from fiscal 2000 to 2001. The growth was primarily the result of increased sales of our graphics processors driven by the strong demand for our products in the PC, workstation and mobile laptop markets and the introduction of our graphics processors into the game console market. Revenue from sales outside of the United States accounted for 82% and 89% of total revenue for fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. Geographic sales are based on bill-to address and this decrease in revenue from sales outside of the United States is primarily attributable to sales of the graphics and media communication processors used in the Microsoft Xbox product billed to Microsoft in the United States. Revenue by geographical region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign CEMs and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers revenue is attributable to end customers located in the United States. Although we achieved substantial growth in product revenue from fiscal 2001 to 2002 and fiscal 2000 to 2001, we do not expect to sustain this rate of growth in future periods. In addition, we expect that the average selling prices of our products will decline over the lives of the products. The declines in average selling prices of 3D graphics processors in general may accelerate as the market continues to develop and competition increases. Gross Profit  Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from contract manufacturers (including assembly, testing and packaging), manufacturing support costs (including labor and overhead associated with such purchases), final test yield fallout, inventory provisions and shipping costs. Our gross profit margin can vary in any period 18   depending on the mix of types of graphics processors sold. Our gross profit margins were 37.9%, 37.1% and 37.9% in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Gross profit increased 90% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 due to an increase in unit shipments and the favorable impact of the higher margin GeForce graphics processors, partially offset by increased sales of the lower margin Xbox graphics and media communication processors. Gross profit increased 92% from fiscal 2000 to 2001, primarily due to significant increases in unit shipments and the favorable impact of the higher margin GeForce graphics processors, partially offset by declining profit margins in our older product families. Although we achieved substantial growth in gross profit in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, we do not expect to sustain these rates of growth in future periods.  Operating Expenses  Research and Development.    Research and development expenses consist of salaries and benefits, cost of development tools and software, cost of new product prototypes and consultant costs. Research and development expenses increased by $67.9 million, or 79%, from fiscal 2001 to 2002 primarily due to a $31.9 million increase related to additional personnel, including certain employees hired from 3dfx in connection with our acquisition of certain of their assets as discussed below, a $13.5 million increase associated with lab equipment, software licenses, maintenance fees and depreciation charges, a $11.7 million increase related to engineering costs to develop our next generation products, and a $10.8 million increase in facilities costs due to the move into our new headquarters and other expenses during the year. Research and development expenses increased by $39.1 million, or 83%, from fiscal 2000 to 2001, primarily due to the addition of personnel and related engineering costs to support our next generation products, such as depreciation charges incurred on capital expenditures and software license and maintenance fees.  We anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development. Research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenues.  Sales, General and Administrative.    Sales, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions and bonuses, promotional tradeshow and advertising expenses, travel and entertainment expenses and legal and accounting expenses. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased $38.5 million, or 66%, from fiscal 2001 to 2002 primarily due to a $21.5 million increase related to additional personnel and commissions, a $6.2 million increase in tradeshow and product launch costs, and a $10.8 million increase in facilities costs due to the move into our new headquarters and other increases associated with general administrative activities, American Red Cross donation associated with the events of September 11, 2001, and travel and entertainment expenses. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by $22.4 million, or 62%, from fiscal 2000 to 2001, primarily due to costs associated with additional personnel, commissions on sales of the NVIDIA TNT2 and GeForce families of graphic processors and bonuses.  We expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our operations and our sales. General and administrative expenses are also likely to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our operations and to be affected by legal and accounting expenses incurred in connection with our recent internal accounting review.  Discontinued Use of Property  Discontinued use of property consists of write-offs of $3.7 million relating to our previous office space in Santa Clara, California. Since we relocated in June 2001, we have been unable to secure a subtenant for our previous office space due to the decrease in demand for commercial rental space in Silicon Valley. The write-offs consist of all remaining costs related to the preexisting lease, including rental payments, capitalized leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. 19  Amortization of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets  Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and intangible assets from the asset purchase from 3dfx. The initial allocation of the purchase price was (a) $3.0 million to workforce in place, amortized over two years; (b) $11.3 million to patents and trademarks, amortized over five years; and (c) $57.4 million to goodwill, amortized over five years. Additional consideration is potentially payable to 3dfx, subject to 3dfx satisfying certain conditions.  In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, amounts allocated to workforce will be reclassified into goodwill and all goodwill will no longer be amortized beginning fiscal year 2003. These assets will be assessed for impairment at least on an annual basis.  Acquisition Related Charges  Acquisition related charges are attributable to expenses related to the acquisition of assets of 3dfx. These charges primarily consisted of bonuses for former 3dfx employees.  Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net  Interest income primarily consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest expense primarily consists of interest incurred as a result of capital lease obligations and interest on our convertible debt. Interest income increased $6.4 million from fiscal 2001 to 2002 due to higher average cash balances as a result of a $200.0 million advance received from Microsoft in connection with our agreement with Microsoft and the receipt of $387.4 million from our 4¾% convertible subordinated note and common stock offerings, which both closed in October 2000. Interest expense increased in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 due to the issuance of $300.0 million of 4¾% convertible subordinated notes in October 2000. Income Taxes  We had income tax expense of $75.8 million, $46.3 million and $19.4 million in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. Income taxes as a percentage of pretax income were 30.0% in fiscal 2002, 32.0% in fiscal 2001 and 32.2% in fiscal 2000. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased foreign income, which is taxed at rates lower than the statutory rates in the United States.  Amortization of Stock-Based Compensation  With respect to stock options granted to employees, we recorded deferred compensation of $4.3 million in 1997 and $361,000 in the one month ended January 31, 1998. These amounts were amortized over the vesting period of the individual options, generally four years. We amortized approximately $6,000 in fiscal 2002, $112,000 in fiscal 2001 and $662,000 in fiscal 2000. Deferred compensation was fully amortized in fiscal 2002.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of January 27, 2002, we had $791.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $117.1 million from the end of fiscal 2001. We historically have held our cash balances in cash or cash equivalents, such as money market funds. In August 2001, we began to invest in marketable securities. Our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed by several financial institutions. Our investment policy requires the purchase of top-tier investment grade securities, the diversification of asset type and limits on our portfolio duration. 20  Operating activities generated cash of $160.8 million, $267.9 million and $15.9 million during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The $267.9 million in fiscal 2001 includes the $200.0 million advance from Microsoft. The decrease from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 was due to the draw down of the $200.0 million advance from Microsoft, offset by the increase in net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Income tax benefit derived from the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of acquired stock in association with employees exercise of stock options totaled $88.9 million in fiscal 2002 compared to $63.2 million in fiscal 2001. The increase from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 was due to a substantial increase in net income, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities. Our accounts receivable are highly concentrated. At January 27, 2002, Micro-Star and Edom accounted for approximately 16% and 14% of accounts receivable, respectively. We may be required to write off bad debts in the future, which could harm our business.  Our investing activities have consisted primarily of the purchase of certain assets from various businesses, investments in marketable securities, and purchases of property and equipment and leasehold improvements for our new facility. We incurred acquisition costs of $64.1 million during fiscal 2002, primarily due to purchase of assets from 3dfx. There were no significant asset purchase transactions in the prior years. We purchased marketable securities totaling approximately $472.9 million during fiscal 2002. We incurred $97.0 million, $36.3 million and $11.6 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, primarily attributable to our new facility as well as for purchases of computer and emulation equipment to support increased research and development. We expect capital expenditures to increase as we further expand research and development initiatives and as our employee base grows. The timing and amount of future capital expenditures will depend primarily on our future growth. We expect to spend approximately $70.0 million to $80.0 million for capital expenditures in fiscal 2003, primarily for software licenses, emulation equipment, purchase of computer and engineering workstations, future phases of our enterprise resource planning system implementation, and tenant and leasehold improvements in our new headquarters facility. In addition, we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of businesses or assets.  In April 2000, we entered into leases for our new headquarters complex in Santa Clara, California. Our new complex comprises four buildings, representing approximately 500,000 total square feet. The first phase of two buildings consisting of approximately 250,000 square feet was completed in June 2001, and the second phase of one building consisting of approximately 125,000 square feet was completed in July 2001. Restricted cash deposits of $17.5 million were released upon completion of the first and second phases. The last phase consisting of approximately 125,000 square feet was completed in February 2002. The $7.0 million in restricted cash relating to letters of credit in place for the developer of the new facility is expected to be released in May 2002. The leases expire in 2012 and include two seven-year renewals at our option. The future minimum lease payments under these operating leases total approximately $224.3 million over the terms of the leases.  Financing activities provided cash of $99.1 million during fiscal 2002 compared to $405.6 million in fiscal 2001 and $7.0 million in fiscal 2000. On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed, under certain terms and conditions, to develop and sell processors for use in the Xbox video game console. In April 2000, Microsoft paid us $200.0 million under the agreement as an advance against processor purchases. This advance has been fully utilized due to purchases made by Microsoft through the quarter ended April 28, 2002 and Microsoft is currently paying in advance for processor chipsets sold to it. We have been engaged with Microsoft in discussions related to pricing and volumes of the Xbox chipset sold to them by NVIDIA. These discussions and our agreement with Microsoft contemplated use of a third party to resolve matters and on April 23, 2002 Microsoft submitted the matter to binding arbitration. Microsoft has requested that the arbitration panel require that we supply chipsets in whatever quantities are ordered by Microsoft. Microsoft has also asked for damages for alleged violations of the agreement and requested that the arbitration panel reduce chipset prices paid by Microsoft. We do not believe we have a requirements obligation to Microsoft and we plan to submit our position to the arbitration panel shortly. For sales of the Xbox media communication processor, we have deferred revenue in an amount equal to the difference between the price being paid by Microsoft and the price Microsoft claims it should be paying. This amount was approximately $13.2 million as of January 27, 2002, the end of our fiscal 2002. We expect that we will continue to defer such amount on future sales of this processor until resolution of the matter. 21  Common Stock and Convertible Subordinated Note Offering  In October 2000, we sold 2,800,000 shares of our common stock and $300.0 million of convertible subordinated notes due October 15, 2007 in a public offering. Proceeds from the offering were approximately $387.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. Issuance costs related to the offering are being amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the notes. Interest on the convertible subordinated notes accrues at the rate of 4 3/4% per annum and is payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing April 15, 2001. The convertible subordinated notes are redeemable at our option on or after October 20, 2003. The notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $46.36 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. 3dfx Asset Purchase  On April 18, 2001, we completed the purchase of certain assets of 3dfx, including patents and patent applications. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the cash consideration due at the closing was $70.0 million, less $15.0 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a Credit Agreement dated December 15, 2000, between us and 3dfx. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, following the closing, we are to pay 3dfx additional consideration in the form of stock equal to two million shares of NVIDIA common stock, subject to 3dfx satisfying certain conditions. If the debts and liabilities of 3dfx can be satisfied for less than $25.0 million and in accordance with the provisions as set forth in the agreement, under some circumstances, 3dfx could receive a post-closing advance from us of up to $25.0 million and this advance would reduce the number of shares of NVIDIA common stock potentially payable to 3dfx by up to one million shares. In the event 3dfx cannot satisfy all of its obligations for $25.0 million, NVIDIA will not be obligated to pay any additional consideration. At this time, 3dfx has not satisfied all terms and conditions necessary to receive any contingent consideration. Consequently, due to the possibility of contingent consideration, the components of the final purchase price could differ from those presented in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The transaction is accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. As a result, this purchase transaction has impacted our working capital in fiscal year 2002 and may have further impact if the additional conditions are met by 3dfx. Contractual Cash Obligations  The following summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of January 27, 2002 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods: Contractual Cash Obligations | Total | | 1 Year | | 2-3 Years | 4-5 Years | | After 5 Years--------------------------------------+----------------+---------+--------+---+-----------+-----------+--------+-------------- | (in thousands)Interest on note obligation (1) | $ | 81,938 | | $ | 14,250 | $ | 28,500 | | $ | 28,500 | $ | 10,688 3dfx post-closing advance (2) | | 25,000 | | | 25,000 | |  | | |  | |  Interest on capital lease obligations | | 1,118 | | | 700 | | 418 | | |  | |  Operating leases | | 234,797 | | | 20,772 | | 43,486 | | | 44,866 | | 125,673Purchase obligations (3) | | 540,950 | | | 540,950 | |  | | |  | |  Royalty and maintenance commitments | | 3,368 | | | 1,509 | | 1,609 | | | 250 | |  Other long term obligations | | 975 | | | 325 | | 650 | | |  | |  Total contractual cash obligations | $ | 888,146 | | $ | 603,506 | $ | 74,663 | | $ | 73,616 | $ | 136,361(1) | Our convertible subordinated notes due 2007 possess a fixed interest rate of 4¾%.

As such, actual future cash obligations may be significantly lower.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) | If the debts and liabilities of 3dfx cannot be satisfied, under some circumstances, 3dfx could receive a post-closing advance from us of up to $25.0 million and this advance would reduce the number of shares of common stock potentially payable to 3dfx by up to one million shares.----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(3) | Represents our noncancelable inventory purchase commitments at January 27, 2002.----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements  We believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then-current stockholders. We also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures, which could harm our business. Factors which could affect our cash used or generated from operations and as a result, our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include:  | decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers products;--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | inability to successfully develop and produce in volume our next-generation products;--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices; and--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors.--+----------------------------------------------------------------------- For additional factors see Business RiskOur operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is set forth in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the subheading New Accounting Pronouncements, which information is hereby incorporated by reference."

Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue.  | Year Ended | -------------------------------------------------+------------------+-- | January 26, 2003 | | January 27, 2002 | | January 28, 2001 | Revenue | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %Cost of revenue | 69.5 | | 62.1 | | 62.9 | Cost of revenue related to stock option exchange | 0.3 | |  | |  | Gross profit | 30.2 | | 37.9 | | 37.1 | Operating expenses: | | | | | | Research and development | 11.8 | | 11.3 | | 11.7 | Sales, general and administrative | 7.9 | | 7.2 | | 8.0 | Stock option exchange | 2.9 | |  | |  | Amortization of goodwill | 0.0 | | 0.7 | |  | Acquisition related charges | 0.0 | | 0.7 | |  | Discontinued use of property | 0.0 | | 0.3 | |  | Total operating expenses | 22.6 | | 20.2 | | 19.7 | Operating income | 7.6 | | 17.7 | | 17.4 | Interest and other income, net | 0.3 | | 0.8 | | 2.3 | Income before income tax expense | 7.9 | | 18.5 | | 19.7 | Income tax expense | 3.1 | | 5.5 | | 6.3 | Net income | 4.8 | % | 13.0 | % | 13.4 | %Fiscal Years Ended January 26, 2003, January 27, 2002, and January 28, 2001 Revenue Revenue was $1.91 billion in fiscal 2003, $1.37 billion in fiscal 2002, and $735.3 million in fiscal 2001, which represented an increase of 39% from fiscal 2002 to 2003 and 86% from fiscal 2001 to 2002. The growth was primarily the result of increased sales of our graphics processors driven by significant shipments of Xbox processors in addition to the strong overall demand for our products in the workstation, mobile and platform processor product lines. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and North America accounted for 68% and 82% of total revenue for fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. Revenue by geographical region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign CEMs and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers revenue is attributable to end customers located in the United States. The decrease in the percentage of revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States is primarily attributable to increased sales of the graphics and media communication processors used in the Microsoft Xbox product billed to Microsoft in the United States. 16  Although we achieved substantial growth in revenue from fiscal 2002 to 2003 and fiscal 2001 to 2002, we do not expect to sustain this rate of growth in future periods. In addition, we expect that the average selling prices of our products will decline over the lives of the products. The declines in average selling prices of 3D graphics processors in general may accelerate as the market continues to develop and competition increases. Gross Profit Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors (including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging), manufacturing support costs (including labor and overhead associated with such purchases), final test yield fallout, inventory provisions and shipping costs. Our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of graphics processors sold. Gross margin is the ratio of gross profit to revenue. Our gross margins were 30%, 38% and 37% in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Gross margin for fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 decreased primarily due to the shift in mix of business and an inventory write-down. During fiscal 2003, sales of Xbox processors, which generally have lower margins than our other products, comprised 23% of our overall revenue as compared to 9% in fiscal 2002. See Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of our relationship with Microsoft. In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2003 we wrote down inventory of approximately $21 million related to certain Xbox processors and nForce chipsets. Gross margin increased from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 due to an increase in unit shipments and the favorable impact of the higher margin GeForce graphics processors, partially offset by increased sales of the lower margin Xbox graphics and media communication processors. In the future, we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take additional write-downs if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product demand. A reduction in demand could negatively impact our gross margins. Although we achieved substantial growth in gross profit during fiscal 2003 from the same period a year ago, we do not expect to sustain this rate of growth in future periods. Operating Expenses Research and Development.    Research and development expenses consist of salaries and benefits, cost of development tools and software, cost of new product prototypes and consultant costs. Research and development expenses increased by $70.1 million, or 45%, from fiscal 2002 to 2003 primarily due to a $32.9 million increase related to additional personnel, a $22.2 million increase associated with lab equipment, software licenses, maintenance fees and depreciation charges, a $4.5 million increase related to engineering costs to develop our next generation products, and a $10.5 million increase in facilities costs due to the move into a new building at our headquarters and a full year of occupation in all headquarter buildings as well as other expenses during the year. Research and development expenses increased by $68.7 million, or 80%, from fiscal 2001 to 2002 primarily due to a $31.9 million increase related to additional personnel, including certain employees hired from 3dfx in connection with our acquisition of certain of their assets as discussed below, a $14.3 million increase associated with lab equipment, software licenses, maintenance fees and depreciation charges, a $11.7 million increase related to engineering costs to develop our next generation products, and a $10.8 million increase in facilities costs due to the move into several buildings at our new headquarters and other expenses during the year. We anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development. Research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenues. Sales, General and Administrative.    Sales, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions and bonuses, promotional tradeshow and advertising expenses, travel and entertainment expenses and legal and accounting expenses. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased $52.5 million, or 53%, from fiscal 2002 to 2003 primarily due to a $16.4 million increase related to additional personnel and 17   commissions, a $16.6 million increase in legal and accounting expenses associated with various legal proceedings, a $9.0 million increase in equipment and software primarily related to the enhancement of our computer systems, a $7.9 million increase in tradeshow and product launch costs, and a $2.6 million increase in facilities costs due to the move into a new building at our headquarters and a full year of occupation in all headquarter buildings as well as other increases associated with general administrative activities and travel and entertainment expenses. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased $40.2 million, or 69%, from fiscal 2001 to 2002 primarily due to a $21.5 million increase related to additional personnel and commissions, a $6.2 million increase in tradeshow and product launch costs, and a $12.5 million increase in facilities costs due to the move into several buildings at our new headquarters and other increases associated with general administrative activities, an American Red Cross donation associated with the events of September 11, 2001, and travel and entertainment expenses. We expect sales, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to support our operations, expand our sales and protect our business interests. Stock Option Exchange On September 26, 2002, we commenced an offer (the Offer) to our employees to exchange outstanding stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than $27.00 per share (Eligible Options). Stock options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 20,615,000 shares were eligible for tender at the commencement of the Offer, representing approximately 39% of our outstanding stock options as of the commencement date. Only employees of NVIDIA or one of our subsidiaries as of September 26, 2002 who continued to be employees through the Offer termination date of October 24, 2002 were eligible to participate in the Offer. Employees who were on medical, maternity, workers compensation, military or other statutorily protected leave of absence, or a personal leave of absence, were also eligible to participate in the Offer. Employees who were terminated on or before the Offer termination date of October 24, 2002, were not eligible to participate in the Offer. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and members of our Board of Directors were not eligible to participate in this Offer. Eligible employees who participated in the Offer received, in exchange for the cancellation of Eligible Options, a fixed amount of consideration, represented by fully vested, non-forfeitable common stock and applicable withholding taxes, equal to the number of shares underlying such Eligible Options, multiplied by $3.20, less the amount of applicable tax withholdings, divided by $10.46, the closing price of our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market on October 24, 2002. We concluded that the consideration paid for the Eligible Options represented substantial consideration as required by Issue 39(f) of EITF Issue No. 00-23 Issues Relating to Accounting for Stock Compensation Under APB Opinion No. 25 and FASB Interpretation No. 44, as the $3.20 per Eligible Option was at least the fair value for each Eligible Option, as determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. In determining the fair value of the Eligible Options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we used the following assumptions: (i) the expected remaining life was deemed to be the remaining term of the options, which was approximately 7.8 years; (ii) a volatility of 50.0% during the expected life; (iii) a risk-free interest rate of 3.71%; and (iv) no dividends. The amount of $3.20 per Eligible Option was established at the commencement of the offer period and remained unchanged throughout the offer period. Variable accounting is not required under Issue 39(a) of EITF Issue No. 00-23 for Eligible Options subject to the Offer that were not surrendered for cancellation, because: (i) the shares of our common stock offered as consideration for the surrendered options were fully vested and non-forfeitable; and (ii) the number of shares to be received by an employee who accepted the Offer was based on the number of surrendered Eligible Options multiplied by $3.20, divided by the fair value of the stock at the date of exchange. We further concluded that the look back and look forward provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 44, paragraph 45 did apply to the stock options surrendered for cancellation. Based on the terms of the Offer, variable accounting is not required for any of our outstanding stock options existing at the time of the Offer. We do not intend to grant stock options to any participants in the Offer for at least six months following October 24, 2002. If any stock options are granted to 18   participants in the Offer within the six months following October 24, 2002, those stock options will receive variable accounting. On October 24, 2002, the offer period ended and we were obligated to exchange approximately 18,843,000 Eligible Options for total consideration of $61,832,000, consisting of $39,906,000 in fully vested, non-forfeitable shares of our common stock (approximately 3,815,000 shares) and $21,926,000 in employer and employee related taxes. The number of fully vested, non-forfeitable shares of our common stock to be issued was determined by dividing the total consideration due (less the amount of applicable tax withholdings) by the closing price of our common stock on October 24, 2002, of $10.46 per share. The shares of our common stock issued in exchange for Eligible Options were fully vested. However, a portion of the shares equal to 25% of the total consideration, based on the closing price of our common stock on the offer termination date, have a six month holding period, and a portion of the shares equal to 25% of such total consideration have a one year holding period. Withholding taxes and other charges were deducted from the remaining 50% of the total consideration, and the shares issued after such withholding did not have a holding restriction. Amortization of Goodwill During fiscal 2002, amortization of goodwill was associated with goodwill from the asset purchase from 3dfx. The initial allocation of the purchase price included $57.4 million of goodwill, plus approximately $3.0 million of intangible assets previously allocated to workforce in place, which was reclassified into goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal 2003. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we no longer amortize goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal 2003. We have elected to perform our annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We have completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2003 and concluded that there was no impairment. Acquisition Related Charges Acquisition related charges are attributable to expenses related to the acquisition of assets from 3dfx in fiscal 2002. These charges primarily consisted of bonuses for former 3dfx employees. Discontinued Use of Property Discontinued use of property consists of write-offs of $3.7 million relating to our previous office space in Santa Clara, California. Since we relocated in June 2001, we have been unable to secure a subtenant for our previous office space due to the decrease in demand for commercial rental space in Silicon Valley. The write-offs consist of all remaining costs related to the preexisting lease, including rental payments, capitalized leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Interest and Other Income, Net Interest and other income, net decreased to $6.6 million in fiscal 2003 from $11.0 million in fiscal 2002 and $16.7 million in fiscal 2001. Interest income, which primarily consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased $4.5 million from fiscal 2002 to 2003 due to the decline in market interest rates. Interest income increased $6.4 million from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 due to higher average cash balances as a result of a $200.0 million advance received from Microsoft in connection with our agreement with Microsoft and the receipt of $387.5 million from our 4¾% convertible subordinated note and common stock offerings, which both closed in October 2000. Interest expense, which primarily consists of interest incurred as a result of capital lease obligations and interest on our convertible debt was flat from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. Interest expense increased in fiscal 2002 19   compared to fiscal 2001 due to the issuance of $300.0 million of 4¾% convertible subordinated notes in October 2000. Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of $59.8 million, $75.8 million and $46.3 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively. Income taxes as a percentage of pretax income were 39.7% in fiscal 2003, 30.0% in fiscal 2002 and 32.0% in fiscal 2001. The increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to not recording any income tax expense or benefit for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 as our loss before income tax expense was primarily attributable to a stock compensation charge for which no tax benefit may be available. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of January 26, 2003, we had $1.03 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $237.0 million from the end of fiscal 2002. In August 2001, we began to invest in marketable securities. Our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed by several financial institutions. Our investment policy requires the purchase of top-tier investment grade securities, the diversification of asset type and certain limits on our portfolio duration. Operating activities generated cash of $265.0 million, $160.8 million and $267.9 million during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to the decrease in inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets and deferred tax assets offset by the decrease in accounts payable. Cash used in investing activities has consisted primarily of investments in marketable securities, the purchase of certain assets from various businesses and purchases of property and equipment, which include leasehold improvements for our facilities. Net cash used in investing activities was $277.3 million in fiscal 2003, primarily due to $217.3 million of net purchases of marketable securities. We incurred $63.1 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 primarily attributable to our new headquarters facility, as well as for purchases of computer and emulation equipment to support increased research and development. We expect to spend approximately $50.0 million to $60.0 million for capital expenditures in fiscal 2004, primarily for software licenses, emulation equipment, computer and engineering workstations and future phases of our enterprise resource planning system implementation. In addition, we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of businesses or assets. Financing activities provided cash of $26.3 million during fiscal 2003 compared to $99.1 million in fiscal 2002. The decrease in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 was due to a decrease in employee stock option exercises. Common Stock and Convertible Subordinated Debenture Offering In October 2000, we sold 2,800,000 shares of our common stock and $300.0 million of convertible subordinated debentures due October 15, 2007 in a public offering. Proceeds from the offering were approximately $387.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. Issuance costs related to the offering are being amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the debentures. Interest on the convertible subordinated debentures accrues at the rate of 4 ¾% per annum and is payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing April 15, 2001. The convertible subordinated debentures are redeemable at our option on or after October 20, 2003. The debentures are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $46.36 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. 20  3dfx Asset Purchase On April 18, 2001, we completed the purchase of certain assets of 3dfx, including patents and patent applications. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the cash consideration due at the closing was $70.0 million, less $15.0 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a Credit Agreement dated December 15, 2000. The Asset Purchase Agreement also provides, subject to the other provisions thereof, that if 3dfx certifies to our satisfaction all its debts and other liabilities have been provided for, then we are obligated to pay 3dfx two million shares of NVIDIA common stock. If 3dfx cannot make such a certification, but instead certifies to our satisfaction that its debts and liabilities can be satisfied for less than $25.0 million, then 3dfx can elect to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and receive a reduced number of shares of our common stock, with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by $25.00 per share. If 3dfx cannot certify that all of its debts and liabilities have been provided for, or can be satisfied, for less than $25.0 million, we are not obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets. On October 15, 2002, 3dfx filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. We believe that the bankruptcy filing by 3dfx will allow a determination of the full number and scope of 3dfxs debts and liabilities. NVIDIA may be obligated under the Asset Purchase Agreement to pay 3dfx the contingent consideration following this determination, subject to offsets for NVIDIAs claims against 3dfx arising from the Asset Purchase Agreement. On March 12, 2003, we were served with a complaint by the Trustee for 3dfx seeking, among other things, additional payment for the purchased assets and the assumption by us of 3dfxs liabilities. In addition, Carlyle Fortran Trust and CarrAmerica, former landlords of 3dfx, have filed suits against us seeking payment of the rents due by 3dfx.Contractual Cash Obligations The following summarizes our contractual cash obligations that are both on our balance sheet and off balance sheet as of January 26, 2003 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods: Contractual Cash Obligations | Total | | 1 Year | | 2-3 Years | 4-5 Years | | After 5 Years----------------------------------------------+----------------+---------+--------+---+-----------+-----------+--------+-------------- | (in thousands)Convertible subordinated notes | $ | 300,000 | | |  | |  | | $ | 300,000 | |  Interest on convertible subordinated notes(1) | $ | 67,687 | | $ | 14,250 | $ | 28,500 | | $ | 24,937 | |  Capital lease obligations | $ | 11,316 | | $ | 6,260 | $ | 5,056 | | |  | |  Operating leases | $ | 219,096 | | $ | 22,995 | $ | 46,180 | | $ | 47,201 | $ | 102,720Purchase obligations(2) | $ | 210,270 | | $ | 210,270 | |  | | |  | |  Royalty and license commitments | $ | 2,612 | | $ | 1,871 | $ | 741 | | |  | |  Other | $ | 520 | | |  | $ | 520 | | |  | |  Total contractual cash obligations | $ | 811,501 | | $ | 255,646 | $ | 80,997 | | $ | 372,138 | $ | 102,720(1) | Our convertible subordinated notes due 2007 possess a fixed interest rate of 4¾%. The amount of interest obligation assumes that the notes are held until maturity and not redeemed or converted into shares of common stock at an earlier date. The convertible subordinated notes are redeemable at our option on or after October 20, 2003. The notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date. As such, actual future cash obligations may be significantly lower.----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(2) | Represents our noncancelable inventory purchase commitments as of January 26, 2003.----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements We believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then-current stockholders. We also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures, 21   which could harm our business. Factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and, as a result, our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include:  | decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers products;--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next-generation products;--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices; and--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors.--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------For additional factors see Business RisksOur operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline. Other Information Consistent with Section 10A(i)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as added by Section 202 of the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002, NVIDIA is responsible for disclosing the nature of the non-audit services approved by our Audit Committee during a quarter to be performed by KPMG LLP, our independent auditor.

The revenue decrease from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 was primarily the result of a significant decrease in sales of Xbox processors to Microsoft, offset by growth in our GPU, MCP and UMP products. The revenue growth from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 was primarily the result of significant sales of Xbox processors in addition to the strong overall demand for our GPU and MCP products. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and other Americas accounted for 75%, 68% and 82% of total revenue for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign CEMs and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location. The increase in the percentage of revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and other Americas for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 is primarily due to decreased sales of XGPUs and MCPs used in the Microsoft Xbox product, which are billed to Microsoft in the United States. The decrease in the percentage of revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States for fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 is primarily due to increased sales of XGPUs and MCPs used in the Microsoft Xbox product.Sales to Microsoft accounted for approximately 15% of revenues for fiscal 2004. Our other three largest customers accounted for approximately 45% of revenues for fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2003, sales to Microsoft accounted for approximately 23% of revenues. Our other three largest customers accounted for approximately 41% of revenues for fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2002, sales to Microsoft accounted for approximately 9% of revenues. Our other three largest customers accounted for approximately 44% of revenues for fiscal 2002.In future periods, our revenue may be affected by demand for and market acceptance of our products and/or our customers products, our ability to successfully develop and produce our products in volume production, competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices, and new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors.Gross Profit Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors (including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging), manufacturing support costs (including labor and overhead associated with such purchases), final test yield fallout, inventory provisions and shipping costs. Gross margin is the ratio of gross profit to revenue. Our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of products sold. Our gross margin was 29%, 30% and 38% in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Gross margin for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 decreased primarily due to a shift in the mix of product sales to our new generation of GeForce FX products. Our GeForce FX products generally have experienced lower gross margins than previous GeForce products. This decrease was offset by an increase in gross margins on sales of Xbox processors in fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003, which resulted from the pricing settlement with Microsoft that we announced on February 6, 2003. Gross margin for fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 decreased primarily due to a shift in mix of product sales that included more sales of Xbox processors which, at that time, generally had lower margins than our other products. In addition, the decrease was due to an inventory write-down of approximately $21.0 million related to certain Xbox processors and nForce platform processors during the second quarter of fiscal 2003, and the stock option exchange expense of $6.2 million that was charged to cost of revenue related to manufacturing personnel during the third quarter of fiscal 2003. In the future, we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take additional write-downs if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product demand. A reduction in demand and market acceptance of our products and/or our customers products could also negatively impact our gross margins. We do not expect past results to be indicative of future periods. We remain intensely focused on driving down cost and improving gross margins. We expect improvement in our gross margins and believe our gross margins can be 30% or more.Operating Expenses Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist of salaries and benefits, cost of development tools and software, cost of new product prototypes and consultant costs. Research and development expenses increased by $45.1 million, or 20%, from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a $33.2 million increase related to additional personnel, including approximately 60 employees that we obtained as a result of our acquisition of MediaQ, a $21.2 million increase associated with lab equipment, software licenses, maintenance fees and increased depreciation and amortization charges, and a $2.0 million increase in facility expenses, offset by a $11.3 million decrease in new product development costs and other expenses during the period. Research and development expenses increased by $70.1 million, or 45%, from fiscal 2002 to 2003 primarily due to a $32.9 million increase related to additional personnel, a $22.2 million increase associated with lab equipment, software licenses, maintenance fees and depreciation charges, a $4.5 million increase related to engineering costs to develop next generation products, and a $10.5 million increase in facilities costs due to the move into a new building at our headquarters and a full year of occupation in all headquarter buildings as well as other expenses during the year. 17 We anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development. Research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenues.Sales, General and Administrative. Sales, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions and bonuses, promotional tradeshow and advertising expenses, travel and entertainment expenses and legal and accounting expenses. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased $13.8 million, or 9%, from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a $12.9 million increase related to additional personnel, a $9.1 million increase in tradeshow, marketing development and general administrative activities and a $3.2 million increase in computer software and equipment related to the enhancement of our computer systems and the depreciation and amortization of new equipment. These increases were offset by an $11.4 million decrease in legal fees related to higher legal fees incurred during fiscal 2003 for various issues that have since been resolved, including the SEC inquiry, Microsoft arbitration and shareholder lawsuits. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased $52.5 million, or 53%, from fiscal 2002 to 2003 primarily due to a $16.4 million increase related to additional personnel and commissions, a $16.6 million increase in legal and accounting expenses associated with various legal proceedings, a $9.0 million increase in equipment and software primarily related to the enhancement of our computer systems, a $7.9 million increase in tradeshow and product launch costs, and a $2.6 million increase in facilities costs due to the move into a new building at our headquarters and a full year of occupation in all headquarter buildings as well as other increases associated with general administrative activities and travel and entertainment expenses. We expect sales, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to support our operations, expand our sales, launch our new products and protect our business interests. In-process research and development. In connection with our acquisition of MediaQ in August 2003, we wrote-off $3.5 million of in-process research and development expense, or IPR&D, that had not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use. In accordance with SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs , as clarified by FIN 4, Applicability of SFAS No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method an interpretation of SFAS No. 2 ,amounts assigned to IPR&D meeting the above-stated criteria must be charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price.Stock Option Exchange. On September 26, 2002, we commenced an offer, or the Offer, to our employees to exchange outstanding stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than $27.00 per share, or Eligible Options. Stock options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 20,615,000 shares were eligible for tender at the commencement of the Offer, representing approximately 39% of our outstanding stock options as of the commencement date. Only employees of NVIDIA or one of our subsidiaries as of September 26, 2002 who continued to be employees through the Offer termination date of October 24, 2002 were eligible to participate in the Offer. Employees who were on medical, maternity, workers compensation, military or other statutorily protected leave of absence, or a personal leave of absence, were also eligible to participate in the Offer. Employees who were terminated on or before the Offer termination date of October 24, 2002, were not eligible to participate in the Offer. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and members of our Board of Directors were not eligible to participate in this Offer. On October 24, 2002, the offer period ended and we were obligated to exchange approximately 18,843,000 Eligible Options for total consideration of $61.8 million, consisting of $39.9 million in fully vested, non-forfeitable shares of our common stock (approximately 3,815,000 shares) and $21.9 million in employer and employee related taxes. The number of fully vested, non-forfeitable shares of our common stock to be issued was determined by dividing the total consideration due (less the amount of applicable tax withholdings) by the closing price of our common stock on October 24, 2002, of $10.46 per share.  18 Amortization of Goodwill. During fiscal 2002, amortization of goodwill was associated with goodwill from the asset purchase from 3dfx. The initial allocation of the purchase price included $57.4 million of goodwill, plus approximately $3.0 million of intangible assets previously allocated to workforce in place, which was reclassified into goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal 2003.In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , we no longer amortize goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal 2003. We have elected to perform our annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2004 and concluded that there was no impairment.Acquisition Related Charges. Acquisition related charges are attributable to expenses related to the acquisition of assets from 3dfx in fiscal 2002. These charges primarily consisted of bonuses to former 3dfx employees.Discontinued Use of Property. Discontinued use of property consists of write-offs of $3.7 million relating to our previous office space in Santa Clara, California. Since we relocated in June 2001, we have been unable to secure a subtenant for our previous office space due to the decrease in demand for commercial rental space in Silicon Valley. The write-offs consist of all remaining costs related to the preexisting lease, including rental payments, capitalized leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. In December 2001, we filed a complaint against Extreme Networks Inc., the sublessor of the property, seeking payment of lease payments and other property charges for the period of July 2001 through December 2001 and seeking a declaration that we are not liable for any future payments under the lease. In July, 2003, we settled the matter with Extreme Networks and in August, 2003, the complaint was dismissed with prejudice.Interest Income and Interest ExpenseInterest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income decreased from $23.2 million to $18.6 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to lower average balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003. This was caused by the redemption of our $300.0 million convertible subordinated debentures in October 2003. Interest income decreased from $27.7 million to $23.2 million from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 primarily due to the decline in market interest rates.Interest expense primarily consists of interest incurred as a result of capital lease obligations and, prior to the redemption in October 2003, interest on our convertible subordinated debentures. Interest expense decreased from $16.5 million to $12.0 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to the redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures.Other Income (Expense), net Other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities and any gains or losses related to the disposal of fixed assets. Other income increased by $3.2 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to $2.5 million of realized gains on the sale of marketable securities during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 as a result of our liquidation of a significant portion of our marketable securities portfolio in order to obtain the cash required to redeem our convertible subordinated debentures in October 2003. Convertible Debenture Redemption ExpenseOn October 24, 2003, we fully redeemed our $300.0 million of 4¾% convertible subordinated debentures due 2007, or the Notes. The aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding was $300.0 million, which included $18.6 million of Notes that we had purchased in the open market during the three months ended October 26, 2003. The redemption price was equal to approximately 102.7% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. In connection with the redemption of the Notes, we recorded a one-time charge of approximately $13.1 million, which included a $7.6 million redemption premium and $5.5 million of unamortized issuance costs.19Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of $12.3 million, $59.8 million and $75.8 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes, or our annual effective tax rate, was 14.1% in fiscal 2004, 39.7% in fiscal 2003 and 30.0% in fiscal 2002. Significant items impacting our annual effective tax rate in fiscal 2004 included the $3.5 million MediaQ IPR&D write-off for which no tax benefit was recognized, the $75.0 million income tax benefit of certain tax contingencies as a result of settlement of our IRS exam, the $38.2 million income tax expense for the accrual of U.S. deferred income taxes on previous permanently reinvested foreign earnings and the $33.6 million income tax expense for the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain previously recognized state deferred tax assets determined not more likely than not to be realized due, in part, to projections of future sources of taxable income.Please refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the components of income tax expense.The increase in our annual effective tax rate from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to our not recording any income tax expense or benefit for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 as our loss before income tax expense for that quarter was primarily attributable to a stock compensation charge for which no tax benefit may be available. We expect our annual effective income tax rate to be 20% for fiscal 2005. Please refer to Part II, Item 7 ""Critical Accounting Policies - Income Taxes"" for items that may affect this estimate.Liquidity and Capital Resources As of January 25, 2004, we had $604.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a decrease of $424.4 million from the end of fiscal 2003. The decrease was primarily due to the $300.0 million redemption of the Notes in October 2003 and the $71.3 million acquisition of MediaQ in August 2003. Our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed by several financial institutions. Our investment policy requires the purchase of top-tier investment grade securities, the diversification of asset type and certain limits on our portfolio duration. Operating activities generated cash of $49.7 million, $265.0 million and $160.8 million during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the increase in inventory and decrease in income taxes payable due to the settlement of certain tax contingencies.Cash used in investing activities has consisted primarily of investments in marketable securities, the purchase of certain assets from various businesses and purchases of property and equipment, which include leasehold improvements for our facilities. Investing activities provided cash of $88.0 million and used cash of $277.3 million during fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to $286.9 million of net sales and maturities of marketable securities as we liquidated a significant portion of our marketable securities portfolio in order to obtain the cash required to redeem the $300.0 million Notes in October 2003. This increase in cash from sales and maturities of marketable securities was offset by $127.6 million in capital expenditures primarily attributable to purchases of new research and development emulation equipment, technology licenses and software and $71.3 million for the acquisition of MediaQ. We expect to spend approximately $80.0 million to $100.0 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2005, primarily for software licenses, emulation equipment, computer and engineering workstations. In addition, we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets.Financing activities used cash of $270.3 million during fiscal 2004 compared to cash provided of $26.3 million in fiscal 2003. The increase in cash used in fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the $300.0 million redemption of the Notes, which included $18.6 million of Notes that we had purchased during the three months ended October 26, 2003. 20Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure RequirementsWe believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then-current stockholders. We also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures, which could harm our business. Factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and, as a result, our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include:·   decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers products;  ·   inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next-generation products;·   competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices; and·   new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors. For additional factors see ""Business Risks  Our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.""Other key factors that could affect our liquidity include:Shelf Registration StatementIn December 2003, we filed a Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, under their ""shelf"" registration process. This shelf registration was declared effective by the SEC on March 25, 2004. Under this shelf registration process, we may sell common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, stock purchase contracts and/or stock purchase units in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of $500.0 million. Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, we intend to use the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. In particular, we expect to incur significant operating expenses in connection with: ·   continuing to develop our technology;·   hiring additional personnel;·   expanding our sales and marketing organization and activities;·   acquiring complementary technologies or businesses; and·   capital expenditures3dfx Asset PurchaseThe 3dfx asset purchase closed on April 18, 2001. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the cash consideration due at the closing was $70.0 million, less $15.0 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a Credit Agreement dated December 15, 2000. The Asset Purchase Agreement also provided, subject to the other provisions thereof, that if 3dfx properly certified that all its debts and other liabilities had been provided for, then we would have been obligated to pay 3dfx two million shares of NVIDIA common stock. If 3dfx could not make such a certification, but instead properly certified that its debts and liabilities could be satisfied for less than $25.0 million, then 3dfx could have elected to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and a reduced number of shares of our common stock, with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by $25.00 per share. If 3dfx could not certify that all of its debts and liabilities had been provided for, or could not be satisfied, for less than $25.0 million, we would not be obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets. We are currently party to litigation relating to certain aspects of the asset purchase and 3dfxs subsequent bankruptcy in October 2002. Please refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this litigation.21Contractual Obligations The following summarizes our contractual obligations that are both on our balance sheet and off balance sheet as of January 25, 2004 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods: Contractual Obligations | Total | Within 1 Year | 23 Years | 4-5 Years | After 5 Years------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+---------------+-----------+-----------+-------------- | (in thousands)Capital lease obligations, including interest | $ | 5,047 | | $ | 4,179 | $ | 868 | $ | -- | $ | -- Operating leases | | 206,242 | | | 24,635 | | 49,950 | | 50,625 | | 81,032Purchase obligations (1) | | 213,289 | | | 213,289 | | -- | | -- | | -- Other liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under GAAP | | 6,520 | | | 2,020 | | 3,000 | | 1,500 | | -- Total contractual obligations | $ | 431,098 | | $ | 244,123 | $ | 53,818 | $ | 52,125 | $ | 81,032 _________________(1)Represents our noncancelable inventory purchase commitments as of January 25, 2004.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is set forth in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the subheading ""New Accounting Pronouncements,"" which information is hereby incorporated by reference. 22"
2005,", as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. OverviewOur Company NVIDIA Corporation is a worldwide leader in graphics and digital media processors dedicated to creating products that enhance the interactive experience on consumer and professional computing platforms. We design, develop and market graphics processing units, or GPUs, media and communications processors, or MCPs, wireless media processors, or WMPs, and related software. Our products are integral to a wide variety of visual computing platforms, including enterprise personal computers, or PCs, consumer PCs, professional workstations, notebook PCs, personal digital assistants, cellular phones, game consoles and digital media centers. We were incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Our objective is to be one of the most important and influential technology companies in the world. Recent Developments Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.In December 2004, we announced that Sony Computer Entertainment Inc., or SCEI, and NVIDIA are jointly developing a custom GPU incorporating our next-generation GeForce GPU and SCEI’s system solutions for SCEI’s next generation PlayStation. The collaboration includes licensing and royalties for the next generation PlayStation as well as all derivatives, including next generation digital consumer electronics devices. In addition, we are licensing to SCEI software development tools for creating shaders and advanced graphics capabilities. For fiscal 2006, we expect to recognize revenue of approximately $30 million from development and software license fees associated with this collaboration. Depending on the ultimate success of this next generation platform, we expect to generate, starting in fiscal 2007, revenue ranging from $50 million to $100 million annually from technology license fees and royalties over a four year period, with the possibility of additional royalties for several years thereafter. The additional royalty stream will depend on the use and success of our technology in future digital consumer electronics devices such as digital televisions and media servers. Intel Cross-license AgreementOn November 19, 2004, NVIDIA and Intel announced that the companies signed a broad, multi-year patent cross-license agreement spanning multiple product lines and product generations. Additionally, the companies signed a multi-year chipset agreement granting NVIDIA a license to implement Intel's front-side bus technology. We believe that this agreement opens a significant opportunity for us to bring our NVIDIA nForce brand to the Intel segment. We expect to commence shipments of our first Intel-based MCP product during the first quarter of fiscal 2006.GeForce 6 SeriesIn April 2004, we announced our latest flagship GPU architecture, the GeForce 6 series. The GeForce 6 series offers a number of new features, including a faster architecture than our GeForce FX series, compliance with many of the latest software standards and on-chip video processors for high-definition encoding and decoding and direct-to-television playback. The GeForce 6 series offers more flexibility for game designers and graphic artists, while increasing performance over our previous top-end product, the GeForce FX 5950. During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we launched the production shipment of the GeForce 6800 Ultra, 6800 GT and 6800, the industry’s first GPUs to support Microsoft’s DirectX 9 Shader Model 3.0. During the third quarter of fiscal 2005, we launched the production shipment of the GeForce 6600 GT and 6600, which are intended for the mainstream market, and the GeForce 6200, which delivers the GeForce 6 Series architecture and performance to the value PC segment. In December 2004, we introduced a version of the GeForce 6200 with TurboCache technology. NVIDIA TurboCache technology is a new, patent pending hardware and software technology, which allows a GPU to render directly to system memory instead of using local memory on the graphics card. Many of the world’s leading PC OEMs, system builders, and add-in card partners have announced plans to build systems and graphics cards utilizing the GeForce 6200 with TurboCache technology.   15 In December 2004, we announced NVIDIA PureVideo technology, which brings consumer electronics quality video to PCs. PureVideo technology eliminates the need for separate hardware or chipsets and takes the load off the PC’s multi-purpose CPU. New notebooks and media centers powered by GeForce 6 with PureVideo technology are expected to be introduced to the market soon.Peripheral Component Interconnect Express, or PCI ExpressThe transition to PCI Express was central to our GPU and MCP objectives during fiscal 2005. Industry adoption of PCI Express was slower than expected during our fiscal 2005.In February 2004, we announced a top-to-bottom family of PCI Express GPUs. By using a PCI Express high-speed interconnect, or HSI, which is a complex piece of networking technology that performs high-speed bi-directional interconnect protocol conversion, we were able to transform our GeForce family of GPUs into PCI Express compatible GPUs. In June 2004, we executed on our strategy to deliver a full line of GPUs ready to support PCI Express chipsets. Our first PCI Express graphics solutions, the GeForce PCX series, were released for retail sale during the second quarter of fiscal 2005. In September 2004, we announced the GeForce 6600 GT and the GeForce 6600. In October 2004, we announced the GeForce 6200, our first native PCI Express GPUs. In November 2004, we announced the launch of GeForce Go 6800 GPU, our first native PCI Express GPU for notebook PCs. In May 2004, we announced the Mobile PCI Express Module Specification, or MXM. MXM was jointly developed by NVIDIA and leading notebook PC manufacturers in an effort to accelerate the adoption of PCI Express-based notebooks in all market segments. MXM is an open design specification that supports a wide range of graphics solutions from any GPU manufacturer, allowing system integrators maximum flexibility for build-to-order with various graphics solutions. MXM also serves as the primary delivery vehicle for our GeForce Go 6 series of GPUs. In August 2004, we announced that PCI-SIG, the Special Interest Group responsible for Conventional PCI, PCI-X and PCI Express industry-standard I/O technologies, had added our PCI Express technology-based products to the PCI-SIG Integrators List, including GPUs designed for workstations, desktop PCs and notebook PCs. In February 2005, we announced the NVIDIA Quadro FX Go 1400 mobile GPU for PCI Express, which provides the performance, programmability, precision and quality that CAD, DCC and scientific applications require.WMP BusinessDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2005, Motorola, Inc. announced their decision to incorporate our GoForce 4000 in their upcoming new line of 3G multimedia phones. In July 2004, we announced that Samsung Electronics Co., or Samsung, had selected our GoForce 2100 media processor for the SCH-M500 Mobile Intelligent Terminal by Samsung, or MITS, phone. We now have design wins with three of the world's top five cellular phone OEMs - Motorola, Samsung and LG Electronics, Inc. In September 2004, we unveiled the GoForce 3D 4500, the world's first 3D WMP. In February 2005, we announced the GoForce 3D 4800. Over the next several years, we expect digital media processing technology to play a critical role in the cellular phone industry. Scalable Link Interface TechnologyIn June 2004, we unveiled a new scalable link interface, or SLI, technology that takes advantage of the increased bandwidth of the PCI Express bus architecture to allow two NVIDIA-based graphics cards to operate in a single PC or workstation. PCI Express-based PCs and workstations based on NVIDIA SLI technology became available in the second half of fiscal 2005 from PC and workstation manufacturers.    16 NVIDIA nForceDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2005, we launched production of the NVIDIA nForce3 250Gb MCP, the first single-chip MCP to offer gigabit Ethernet, dual independent Serial Advanced Technology Attachment, or SATA, controllers, industry leading Redundant Array of Independent Disks, or RAID, features and hardware security processing. In June 2004, we announced the release of the NVIDIA nForce3 Ultra MCP, a MCP for motherboards and PC systems based on the AMD64 computing platform. In October 2004, we introduced the NVIDIA nForce4 MCPs, our new family of high-end PCI Express-based MCPs for AMD64 computing environments. NVIDIA nForce4 MCPs provide the platform technology that is designed to power this year's fastest gaming, enthusiast, and digital media PCs and motherboards, driving the PCI Express transition.In January 2005, we introduced NVIDIA nForce Professional MCPs, which currently are the only PCI Express core-logic solutions for AMD Opteron processor-based server and workstation platforms. The NVIDIA nForce Professional MCP family includes the NVIDIA nForce Professional 2200 and the 2050 MCP.Share-Based PaymentSince inception, we have used stock options and our employee stock purchase program as fundamental components of our compensation packages. To date we generally have not recognized compensation cost for employee stock options or shares sold pursuant to our employee stock purchase program. We believe that these incentives directly motivate our employees and, through the use of vesting, encourage our employees to remain with us. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, or SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005, and requires that we record compensation expense for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan using the fair value of those awards. Expensing these incentives in future periods will materially and adversely affect our reported operating results as the stock-based compensation expense would be charged directly against our reported earnings. To the extent that SFAS No. 123(R) makes it more expensive to grant stock options or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program, we may decide to incur increased cash compensation costs. Repatriation Legislation  The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was signed into law on October 22, 2004. This act creates a temporary incentive for United States multinationals to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the United States at a federal effective tax rate of 5.25%. On December 21, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which allows an enterprise time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings. We have started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision; however, we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after Congress or the Treasury Department provide additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision. We have not provided for United States income taxes on a cumulative total of approximately $174.7 million of undistributed earnings as of January 30, 2005 for certain non-United States subsidiaries as we intended to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside of the United States. We are currently in the process of evaluating whether or not, and to what extent, if any, this provision may benefit us. We expect to complete such evaluation before the end of fiscal 2006. The range of possible amounts that we are considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and $500 million. The potential range of related income tax expense is between zero and $27 million.Future Objectives and Challenges GPU BusinessDuring fiscal 2005, we committed ourselves to recapture technology leadership in our GPU business, while creating an architecture that is cost efficient. With our GeForce 6 family, we captured a significant share of the performance GPU segment, and we are now focused on using that technology leadership position into the mainstream and value GPU segments. By the end of fiscal 2005, we had a top-to-bottom product line that supports Shader Model 3.0 and with SLI, MXM, HSI, TurboCache technology and PureVideo technology. Now, we are focused on growing our GPU business.    17 PCI Express PCI Express is expected to enable a new level of performance for high bandwidth applications like graphics and networking. The transition to PCI Express, which is extremely complex, is central to our GPU and MCP objectives this fiscal year. We initiated this transition by creating our GeForce PCX series of GPUs, using HSI technology. During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we executed on our strategy to deliver a full line of GPUs ready to support PCI Express chipsets. The transition to PCI Express was central to our GPU and MCP objectives during fiscal 2005. Industry adoption of PCI Express was slower than expected during our fiscal 2005 and there is no assurance that the adoption rate will increase during fiscal 2006. Our first PCI Express graphics solutions, the GeForce PCX series, was released for retail sale during the second quarter of fiscal 2005. We expected to ramp up sales of our PCI Express products during the second quarter of fiscal 2005, but as a result of Intel’s delayed PCI Express chipset production, followed by its product recall, the performance desktop segment was impacted by stalling our customers’ production ramp of our GeForce PCX GPUs. During the third quarter of fiscal 2005, we announced and ramped up sales of the GeForce 6600 GT, GeForce 6600 and the GeForce 6200, our first native PCI Express GPUs. Gross Margin Improvement During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, our gross margin was 34.2%, an increase of 4.9% from our gross margin of 29.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Our gross margin was 32.3% for fiscal 2005, an increase of 3.3% from our gross margin of 29.0% for fiscal 2004. These improvements in our gross margin reflect our continuing focus on delivering cost effective product architectures, enhancing business processes and driving profitable growth. We expect gross margin to improve by approximately 0.5% to 1.0% during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 as our GeForce 6 product family becomes an increasing portion of our revenue and as our NVIDIA nForce3 and NVIDIA nForce4 product revenue continues to increase. WMP Business Our WMP objective is to lead the multimedia handheld era by building exciting products that use our expertise, resources, and investments in digital media processing combined with our low power technology. Our WMP business achieved record revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and is expected to achieve substantial revenue levels in fiscal 2006. With the WMPs on our roadmap, we anticipate that future cellular phones will be able to receive television programs, record digital video like a camcorder, enable video phone calls, and be portable game players.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, long-lived assets, goodwill, income taxes and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.  We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this report.  Revenue RecognitionProduct Revenue We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured. For all sales, we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement. We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. At the point of sale, we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured. If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured, we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.    18 Our policy on sales to distributors is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is recognized. Our customer programs primarily involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets. We account for rebates in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 01-9, or EITF 01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products) and, as such, we accrue for 100% of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor. Unclaimed rebates, which historically have not been significant, are reversed to revenue upon expiration of the rebate. Rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale.  Our customer programs also include marketing development funds, or MDFs. We account for MDFs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense in accordance with EITF 01-9. MDFs represent monies paid to retailers, system builders, OEMs, distributors and add-in card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. If market conditions decline, we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered.  We also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.  License and Development Revenue For license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components, we generally recognize license revenue using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting over the period that services are performed. For all license and service arrangements accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method, we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project. We periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate. A provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. To date, we have not recorded any such losses. Costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts. If the amount of revenue recognized exceeds the amounts billed to customers, the excess amount is recorded as unbilled accounts receivable. If the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized, the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue. Revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress. Significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours. Any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period. Investment ImpairmentsWe review all of our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment. For non-marketable equity securities, the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. The indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include the investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects, factors related to the investee’s ability remain in business, such as the investee’s liquidity, and the investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation.Investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired, in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value. When an investee is not considered viable from a financial point of view, we write down the entire investment since we consider the estimated fair market value to be nominal. If an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent, we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired, unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise. Impairments of investments in our portfolio, primarily impairments of non-marketable equity securities, were nil in fiscal 2005 and 2004.  19 Accounts Receivable We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Management determines this allowance, which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on general estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are covered by credit insurance and letters of credit. If the financial condition of our customers, the financial institutions providing letters of credit, or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain credit insurance in the future. Our current credit insurance agreement expires on December 31, -----2005.  As of January 30, 2005, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $1.5 million and our gross accounts receivable balance was $336.2 million. Of the $336.2 million, $68.0 million was covered by credit insurance and $22.4 million was covered by letters of credit. As a percentage of our gross accounts receivable balance, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between 0.4% and 1.5% during fiscal 2004 and 2005. As of January 30, 2005, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented 0.4% of our gross accounts receivable balance. If our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable would have been recorded at 1.5% of our gross accounts receivable balance, then our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balance at January 30, 2005 would have been approximately $4.9 million, rather than the actual balance of $1.5 million.Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis (which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis). We write down our inventory for estimated lower of cost or market, obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand, future product purchase commitments, estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, or if our future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted future demand for such products, additional future inventory write-downs may be required that could adversely affect our operating results. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may have higher gross margins when products are sold. Sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on our gross margin. As of January 30, 2005, our inventory reserve was $33.7 million. As a percentage of our gross inventory balance, our inventory reserve has ranged between 8.8% and 13.4% during fiscal 2004 and 2005. As of January 30, 2005, our inventory reserve represented 9.6% of our gross inventory balance. If our inventory reserve would have been recorded at 13.4% of our gross inventory balance, then our inventory reserve balance at January 30, 2005 would have been approximately $46.8 million, rather than the actual balance of $33.7 million. Inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped.Valuation of Long-lived AssetsWe review long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We utilize a two-step approach to testing long-lived assets for impairment. The first step tests for possible impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator is present, the second step measures whether the asset is recoverable based on a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Our review requires the use of judgment and estimates. No such impairment charges have occurred to date. However, future events or circumstances may result in a charge to earnings if we determine that the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable.     20 Goodwill Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value.  We determined that our reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments for the purposes of completing our Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, impairment test.  We utilize a two-step approach to testing goodwill for impairment. The first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair value-based test. The second step, if necessary, measures the amount of such an impairment by applying fair value-based tests to individual assets and liabilities. We elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We completed our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and concluded that there was no impairment. However, future events or circumstances may result in a charge to earnings in future periods due to the potential for a write-down of goodwill in connection with such tests. Income Taxes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, or SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, we recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We also recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.  Our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements.  As of January 30, 2005, we had a valuation allowance of $190.6 million. Of the total valuation allowance, $145.7 million is attributable to certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options. The tax benefit of these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, if and when realization is sustained, will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders' equity. Of the remaining valuation allowance at January 30, 2005, $19.9 million relates to federal and state tax attributes acquired in certain acquisitions for which realization of the related deferred tax assets was determined not more likely than not to be realized due, in part, to potential utilization limitations as a result of ownership changes; and $25.0 million relates to certain state deferred tax assets that management determined are not more likely than not to be realized due, in part, to projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain acquisitions becomes probable, recognition of these tax benefits would first reduce goodwill to zero, then reduce other non-current intangible assets related to the acquisition to zero with any remaining benefit reported as a reduction to income tax expense. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain state tax benefits becomes probable, we would recognize an income tax benefit in the period such asset is more likely than not to be realized. Contingencies We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.      21 Results of OperationsThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue.  | Year Ended -------------------------------------------------------+------------------ | January 30, | January 25, | January 26,  | 2005 | 2004 | 2003 Revenue | 100.0% | 100.0% | 100.0% Cost of revenue | 67.7 | 71.0 | 69.5 Cost of revenue related to stock option exchange | -- | -- | 0.3 Gross profit | 32.3 | 29.0 | 30.2 Operating expenses: | | | Research and development | 16.7 | 14.8 | 11.8 Sales, general and administrative | 10.0 | 9.1 | 7.9 In-process research and development | -- | 0.2 | -- Stock option exchange | -- | -- | 2.9 Total operating expenses | 26.7 | 24.1 | 22.6 Income from operations | 5.6 | 4.9 | 7.6 Interest and other income, net | 0.6 | 0.5 | 0.3 Convertible debenture redemption expense | -- | (0.7) | -- Income before income tax expense | 6.2 | 4.7 | 7.9 Income tax expense | 1.2 | 0.6 | 3.1 Net income | 5.0% | 4.1% | 4.8% Fiscal Years Ended January 30, 2005, January 25, 2004 and January 26, 2003 Revenue  During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we began reporting three product-line operating segments: the GPU business, which is composed of products that support desktop PCs, notebook PCs and professional workstations; the MCP business, which is composed of NVIDIA nForce products and Xbox related products; and the WMP business, which is comprised of GoForce products that support handheld personal digital assistants and cellular phones. Please refer to Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Revenue was $2.01 billion in fiscal 2005, compared to $1.82 billion in fiscal 2004, which represented an increase of 10%. The revenue increase from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 was primarily the result of increased sales of our NVIDIA Quadro workstation products, increased memory sales, increased sales of our handheld products, increased sales of our notebook GPU products, and increased sales of our desktop products, offset by decreased sales of our Xbox products. The increase in sales of our NVIDIA Quadro workstation products in fiscal 2005 was due to unit sales volume increases, and an increase in average selling prices as a result of increased board sales. The increase in memory sales in fiscal 2005 was a result of the alignment of memory sales with the introduction of our GeForce 6 products during the period. The increase in handheld sales in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to our acquisition of MediaQ, Inc. in October 2003, which represented our initial entry into the handheld market and to sales of our GoForce 4000 product. The increase in notebook GPU sales in fiscal 2005 resulted from sales of our GeForce FX Go notebook GPU products outpacing the decline in our older notebook GPU product lines during the period. The increase in desktop products in fiscal 2005 was a result of a significant increase in sales of our high-end desktop products, offset by a slight decrease in mainstream desktop products. High-end desktop sales increased in fiscal 2005 primarily due to unit volume increases primarily related to our GeForce 6800 and 6600 products. The decrease in mainstream desktop sales in fiscal 2005 was mainly due to competitive pricing in the mainstream consumer segment offset by the ramp of product sales of our GeForce 6200 with TurboCache technology during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Sales of our Xbox products have historically fluctuated based on the timing of orders from Microsoft. Revenue from sales to Microsoft in fiscal 2005 was slightly lower than fiscal 2004 due to unit sales volume increases offset by a lower average sales price. During fiscal 2004, Microsoft announced that it had entered into an agreement with one of our competitors to develop technology for future Xbox products and services. The impact that this announcement may have on our future revenue from Microsoft is uncertain, but we anticipate that we will not achieve historical levels of Xbox revenue in fiscal 2006.  22 Fiscal 2005 was a 53-week year, compared to fiscal 2004 which was a 52-week year, and we believe that this extra week may have had a positive impact on our revenue in fiscal 2005. However, we are not able to quantify the effect of the slightly longer year on our revenue.Revenue was $1.82 billion in fiscal 2004, compared to $1.91 billion in fiscal 2003, which represented a decrease of 5%. This revenue decrease was primarily the result of a significant decrease in sales of Xbox processors to Microsoft, offset by growth in our GPU, MCP and WMP products.   Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and other Americas accounted for 76%, 75% and 68% of total revenue for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign CEMs’ and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers’ revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location. The increase in the percentage of revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and other Americas for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 and for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 is primarily due to decreased sales of XGPUs and MCPs used in the Microsoft Xbox product, which are billed to Microsoft in the United States. Sales to Microsoft accounted for approximately 13% of our revenue for fiscal 2005. Our three other largest customers accounted for approximately 36% of our revenue for fiscal 2005. Sales to Microsoft accounted for approximately 15% of our revenue for fiscal 2004. Our three other largest customers accounted for approximately 45% of our revenue for fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2003, sales to Microsoft accounted for approximately 23% of our revenue. Our three other largest customers accounted for approximately 41% of our revenue for fiscal 2003. Gross Profit Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory provisions and shipping costs. Gross margin is the ratio of gross profit to revenue. Our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of products sold. Our gross margin was 32%, 29% and 30% in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Gross margin improved during fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 as a result of three primary factors. First, during fiscal 2004 our GeForce FX series of GPU products had experienced lower gross margins than previous series of GeForce GPU products, such as the GeForce 4 series. Company-wide efforts were made to drive down cost and improve gross margin and, as a result, during fiscal 2005, we were able to improve our gross margin. In addition, in fiscal 2005, we realized increased sales of our performance GeForce FX desktop GPU products and began shipping our GeForce 6 series GPUs, which are among our highest gross margin products. Finally, revenue from our NVIDIA Quadro workstation products, which typically provide the highest gross margins of any of our products, increased as a percentage of our total revenue during fiscal 2005. This increase in our mix of revenue toward higher-margin products led to a positive impact on overall gross margin. These improvements in our gross margin reflect our continuing focus on delivering cost effective product architecture, enhancing business process and driving profitable growth. We expect gross margin to improve by approximately 0.5% to 1.0% during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 as our GeForce 6 product family comprises an increasing portion of our revenue and as NVIDIA nForce product revenue continues to increase. Gross margin for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 decreased primarily due to a shift in the mix of product sales to our GeForce FX products. Our GeForce FX products generally experienced lower gross margins than previous GeForce products. This decrease was offset by an increase in gross margin on sales of Xbox processors in fiscal 2004, which resulted from the pricing settlement with Microsoft that we announced on February 6, 2003.     23 Operating Expenses Research and Development  | Year Ended | | | | | | Year Ended | | | | --------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------+-------+----------------+---+--------+---+------------------+------+----------------+----------------+-- | Jan. 30, | | Jan. 25, | | $ | | % | | Jan. 25, | Jan. 26, | | $ | | % |  | 2005 | | 2004 | | Change | | Change | | 2004 | 2003 | | Change | | Change |  | (in thousands) | Research and Development: | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Salaries and related benefits | $ | 171.6 | | $ | 137.6 | | $ | 34.0 | | 25 | % | $ | 137.6 | | $ | 104.4 | | $ | 33.2 | | 32 | % Computer software and lab equipment | | 41.1 | | | 36.9 | | | 4.2 | | 11 | % | | 36.9 | | | 33.4 | | | 3.5 | | 11 | % New product development | | 29.0 | | | 18.6 | | | 10.4 | | 56 | % | | 18.6 | | | 29.0 | | | (10.4 | ) | (36 | %)Facility expense | | 31.4 | | | 28.3 | | | 3.1 | | 11 | % | | 28.3 | | | 26.3 | | | 2.0 | | 8 | % Depreciation and amortization | | 56.1 | | | 44.6 | | | 11.5 | | 26 | % | | 44.6 | | | 26.9 | | | 17.7 | | 66 | % Other | | 5.9 | | | 4.0 | | | 1.9 | | 48 | % | | 4.0 | | | 4.9 | | | (0.9 | ) | (18 | %)Total | $ | 335.1 | | $ | 270.0 | | $ | 65.1 | | 24 | % | $ | 270.0 | | $ | 224.9 | | $ | 45.1 | | 20 | % Research and development as a percentage of net revenue | | 17 | % | | 15 | % | | | | | | | 15 | % | | 12 | % | | | | | Research and developments expenses increased by $65.1 million, or 24%, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to a $34.0 million increase related to 174 additional personnel and a $10.4 million increase in new product developments costs related to an overall increase in the number of product tape-outs and in prototype materials. Depreciation and amortization increased $11.5 million due to emulation hardware and software programs that were purchased during fiscal 2004, resulting in a full year of depreciation in fiscal 2005 compared to a partial year of depreciation in fiscal 2004. Computer software and equipment increased $4.2 million primarily due to increased allocation of information technology expenses and facilities increased $3.1 million due to increased facilities expense allocation, both based on the growth in headcount. Research and development expenses increased by $45.1 million, or 20%, from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a $33.2 million increase related to additional personnel, including approximately 60 employees that we hired as a part of our acquisition of MediaQ and a $17.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization, offset by a $10.4 million decrease in new product development costs.We anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development. Research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue.    24 Sales, General and Administrative  | Year Ended | | | | | | Year Ended | | | | -----------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------+-------+----------------+---+--------+---+------------------+------+----------------+----------------+--- | Jan. 30, | | Jan. 25, | | $ | | % | | Jan. 25, | Jan. 26, | | $ | | % |  | 2005 | | 2004 | | Change | | Change | | 2004 | 2003 | | Change | | Change |  | (in thousands) | Sales, General and Administrative: | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Salaries and related benefits | $ | 94.7 | | $ | 76.3 | | $ | 18.4 | | 24 | % | $ | 76.3 | | $ | 63.4 | | $ | 12.9 | | 20 | % Advertising and promotions | | 66.6 | | | 47.2 | | | 19.4 | | 41 | % | | 47.2 | | | 39.6 | | | 7.6 | | 19 | % Legal and accounting fees | | 12.6 | | | 12.6 | | | -- | | -- | | | 12.6 | | | 20.0 | | | (7.4 | ) | (37 | %)Facility expense | | 9.6 | | | 8.3 | | | 1.3 | | 16 | % | | 8.3 | | | 6.8 | | | 1.5 | | 22 | % Depreciation and amortization | | 13.0 | | | 14.6 | | | (1.6 | ) | (11 | %) | | 14.6 | | | 11.4 | | | 3.2 | | 28 | % Other | | 4.3 | | | 6.2 | | | (1.9 | ) | (31 | %) | | 6.2 | | | 10.3 | | | (4.1 | ) | (40 | %)Total | $ | 200.8 | | $ | 165.2 | | $ | 35.6 | | 22 | % | $ | 165.2 | | $ | 151.5 | | $ | 13.7 | | 9 | % Sales, general and administrative as a percentage of net revenue | | 10 | % | | 9 | % | | | | | | | 9 | % | | 8 | % | | | | | Sales, general and administrative expenses increased $35.6 million, or 22%, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to an $18.4 million increase related to 88 additional personnel and a $19.4 million increase in advertising and promotion costs for tradeshows and new product launches and other marketing costs, including travel and customer samples. These increases were offset by a decrease of $1.9 million in other expenses during the period, including a reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts.Sales, general and administrative expenses increased $13.7 million, or 9%, from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a $12.9 million increase in salaries and related benefits related to additional personnel, a $7.6 million increase in advertising and promotions costs for tradeshows and marketing development and a $3.2 million increase in computer software and equipment related to the enhancement of our computer systems and the depreciation and amortization of new equipment. These increases were offset by a $7.4 million decrease in legal fees related to higher legal fees incurred during fiscal 2003 for various issues that have since been resolved, including an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Microsoft arbitration and shareholder lawsuits. In-process research and developmentIn connection with our acquisition of MediaQ in August 2003, we wrote-off $3.5 million of in-process research and development expense, or IPR&D, that had not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use. In accordance with SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, as clarified by FIN 4, Applicability of SFAS No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method an interpretation of SFAS No. 2, amounts assigned to IPR&D meeting the above-stated criteria must be charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price. Interest Income and Interest ExpenseInterest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income decreased from $18.6 million to $11.4 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the result of lower overall balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and due to lower market interest rates. Interest income decreased from $23.2 million to $18.6 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 primarily due to lower overall balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003. This overall decrease was caused by the redemption of our $300.0 million 4¾% convertible subordinated debentures due 2007, or the Notes, in October 2003.     25 Interest expense primarily consists of interest incurred as a result of capital lease obligations and, prior to the redemption in October 2003, interest on the Notes. Interest expense decreased from $12.0 million to $0.2 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005. Interest expense decreased from $16.5 million to $12.0 million from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004. These decreases were primarily due to the redemption of the Notes.Other Income (Expense), net Other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities. Other income decreased by $2.4 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to $2.5 million of realized gains on the sale of marketable securities during fiscal 2004 as a result of our liquidation of a significant portion of our marketable securities portfolio in order to obtain the cash required to redeem the Notes in October 2003. This decrease was offset by a $1.0 million realized gain during fiscal 2005 related to the receipt of cash and marketable securities as part of an investment exchange. Stock Option ExchangeOn September 26, 2002, we commenced an offer, or the Offer, to our employees to exchange outstanding stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than $27.00 per share, or Eligible Options.  The Offer was implemented in order to improve employee morale by realigning the cash and equity components of our compensation programs, eliminate significant out-of-the-money options and reduce the number of outstanding stock options relative to the number of shares outstanding, or ""options overhang"", thereby reducing future potential dilution to existing stockholders.  Stock options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 20,615,000 shares were eligible for tender at the commencement of the Offer, representing approximately 39% of our outstanding stock options as of the commencement date of the offer. Only employees of NVIDIA or one of our subsidiaries as of September 26, 2002 who continued to be employees through the Offer termination date of October 24, 2002 were eligible to participate in the Offer. Employees who were on medical, maternity, worker’s compensation, military or other statutorily protected leaves of absence, or a personal leave of absence, were also eligible to participate in the Offer. Employees who were terminated on or before the Offer termination date of October 24, 2002, were not eligible to participate in the Offer. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and members of our Board of Directors were not eligible to participate in this Offer. Eligible employees who participated in the Offer received, in exchange for the cancellation of Eligible Options, a fixed amount of consideration, represented by fully vested, non-forfeitable common stock less applicable withholding taxes, equal to the number of shares underlying such Eligible Options, multiplied by $3.20, less the amount of applicable tax withholdings, divided by $10.46, the closing price of our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market on October 24, 2002. We concluded that the consideration paid for the Eligible Options represented ""substantial consideration"" as required by Issue 39(f) of EITF Issue No. 00-23 ""Issues Relating to Accounting for Stock Compensation Under APB Opinion No. 25 and FASB Interpretation No. 44,"" as the $3.20 per Eligible Option was at least the fair value for each Eligible Option, as determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. In determining the fair value of the Eligible Options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we used the following assumptions: (i) the expected remaining life was deemed to be the remaining term of the options, which was approximately 7.8 years; (ii) a volatility of 50.0% during the expected life; (iii) a risk-free interest rate of 3.71%; and (iv) no dividends. The amount of $3.20 per Eligible Option was established at the commencement of the offer period and remained unchanged throughout the offer period. Variable accounting is not required under Issue 39(a) of EITF Issue No. 00-23 for Eligible Options subject to the Offer that were not surrendered for cancellation, because: (i) the shares of our common stock offered as consideration for the surrendered options were fully vested and non-forfeitable; and (ii) the number of shares to be received by an employee who accepted the Offer was based on the number of surrendered Eligible Options multiplied by $3.20, divided by the fair value of the stock at the date of exchange. We further concluded that the ""look back"" and ""look forward"" provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 44, paragraph 45 did apply to the stock options surrendered for cancellation. Based on the terms of the Offer, variable accounting is not required for any of our outstanding stock options existing at the time of the Offer. We did not grant stock options to any participants in the Offer for at least six months following October 24, 2002. If any stock options were granted to participants in the Offer within the six months following October 24, 2002, those stock options would have received variable accounting.     26 On October 24, 2002, the offer period ended and we were obligated to exchange approximately 18,843,000 Eligible Options for total consideration of $61.8 million, consisting of $39.9 million in fully vested, non-forfeitable shares of our common stock (approximately 3,815,000 shares) and $21.9 million in employer and employee related taxes. The number of fully vested, non-forfeitable shares of our common stock to be issued was determined by dividing the total consideration due (less the amount of applicable tax withholdings) by the closing price of our common stock on October 24, 2002, of $10.46 per share. The shares of our common stock issued in exchange for Eligible Options were fully vested. However, a portion of the shares equal to 25% of the total consideration, based on the closing price of our common stock on the offer termination date, have a six month holding period, and a portion of the shares equal to 25% of such total consideration have a one year holding period. Withholding taxes and other charges were deducted from the remaining 50% of the total consideration, and the shares issued after such withholding did not have a holding restriction. Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of $25.1 million, $12.3 million and $59.8 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes, or our annual effective tax rate, was 20% in fiscal 2005, 14.1% in fiscal 2004 and 39.7% in fiscal 2003. In the second quarter of fiscal 2004, we revised our annual effective tax rate for the year from 30% to 20%. The change in rate was primarily due to federal and state tax credits and foreign tax rate differentials. In the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2004, we had significant items impacting our annual effective tax rate which included the $3.5 million MediaQ IPR&D write-off for which no tax benefit was recognized, the $75.0 million income tax benefit of certain tax contingencies as a result of settlement of our federal income tax return exam by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, the $38.2 million income tax expense for the accrual of United States deferred income taxes on previous permanently reinvested foreign earnings and the $33.6 million income tax expense for the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain previously recognized state deferred tax assets determined not more likely than not the be realized due, in part, to projections of future taxable income. As a result of this change in rate and the special items incurred during 2004, our annual effective tax rate for such year was 14.1%. In fiscal 2003, we did not record an income tax benefit for the third quarter loss before income tax expense as such loss was primarily attributable to a stock compensation charge for which no income tax benefit may have been available. As a result, our annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 was 39.7%. As of January 25, 2004, the IRS closed our federal income tax return exam for our fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2005, the Joint Committee on Taxation, or the Joint Committee, completed its review of our IRS exam for these fiscal years and closed such exam with no exception to the conclusions reached by the IRS. Accordingly, the results of our exam as recorded in our financial statements for fiscal 2004 accurately reflected our final settlement reached with the IRS that was subsequently closed, without exception, by the Joint Committee during fiscal 2005. Please refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the components of our income tax expense. Convertible Debenture Redemption ExpenseOn October 24, 2003, we fully redeemed the Notes. The aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding was $300.0 million, which included $18.6 million of Notes that we had purchased in the open market during the three months ended October 26, 2003. The redemption price was equal to approximately 102.7% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. In connection with the redemption of the Notes, we recorded a one-time charge in fiscal 2004 of approximately $13.1 million, which included a $7.6 million redemption premium and $5.5 million of unamortized issuance costs.  27 Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of January 30, 2005, we had $670.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $66.0 million from the end of fiscal 2004. Our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed by several financial institutions. Our investment policy requires the purchase of top-tier investment grade securities, the diversification of asset type and certain limits on our portfolio duration.  Operating activities generated cash of $132.2 million, $49.7 million and $265.0 million during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily related to the $25.9 million increase in net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities. On our consolidated balance sheet, accrued liabilities increased $37.3 million primarily due to an increase in rebates payable, which resulted from increased OEM business. Accounts payable increased $52.9 million primarily due to purchases from subcontract manufacturers for inventory. Offsetting these increases, our accounts receivable increased $101.1 million primarily due to increased sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases and sales of marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, which include leasehold improvements for our facilities and intangible assets. Investing activities used cash of $152.0 million and provided cash of $88.0 million during fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2005 was primarily due to $84.7 million of net purchases of marketable securities. In addition, we used $67.3 million for capital expenditures primarily attributable to purchases of leasehold improvements for our new data center at our headquarters campus, new research and development emulation equipment, technology licenses, software and intangible assets. We expect to spend approximately $50 million to $70 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2006, primarily for purchases of software licenses, emulation equipment, computer and engineering workstations. In addition, we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets.  Financing activities provided cash of $13.8 million during fiscal 2005 compared to cash used of $270.3 million during fiscal 2004. Cash provided in fiscal 2005 primarily resulted from $--42.5 million of common stock issued under employee stock plans, offset by $24.6 million related to our stock repurchase program. In fiscal 2004, the cash used was primarily due to the $300.0 million redemption of the Notes, which included $18.6 million of Notes that we had purchased during the three months ended October 26, 2003. Stock Repurchase Program On August 9, 2004, we announced a stock repurchase program under which we may purchase up to $300.0 million of our common stock over a three year period through August 2007. The repurchases will be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, from time to time, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. Our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. The repurchases will be funded from our available working capital. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased 2.1 million shares for a total cost of approximately $24.6 million. We did not repurchase any shares during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure RequirementsWe believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then-current stockholders. We also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures, which could harm our business. Factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and, as a result, our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include:· | decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers’ products; --+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next-generation products; --+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices; and --+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors. --+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------For additional factors see “Business Risks - Risks Related to Our Operations - Our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.”   28 Shelf Registration Statement In December 2003, we filed a Form S-3 with the SEC under its ""shelf"" registration process. This shelf registration was declared effective by the SEC on March 25, 2004. Under this shelf registration statement, we may sell common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, stock purchase contracts and/or stock purchase units in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of $500.0 million. Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, we intend to use the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. 3dfx Asset PurchaseThe 3dfx asset purchase closed on April 18, 2001. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the cash consideration due at the closing was $70.0 million, less $15.0 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a Credit Agreement dated December 15, 2000. The Asset Purchase Agreement also provided, subject to the other provisions thereof, that if 3dfx properly certified that all its debts and other liabilities had been provided for, then we would have been obligated to pay 3dfx two million shares of NVIDIA common stock. If 3dfx could not make such a certification, but instead properly certified that its debts and liabilities could be satisfied for less than $25.0 million, then 3dfx could have elected to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and a reduced number of shares of our common stock, with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by $25.00 per share. If 3dfx could not certify that all of its debts and liabilities had been provided for, or could not be satisfied, for less than $25.0 million, we would not be obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets. We are currently party to litigation relating to certain aspects of the asset purchase and 3dfx’s subsequent bankruptcy in October 2002. Please refer to Item 3: Legal Proceedings for further information regarding this litigation.Contractual Obligations The following summarizes our contractual obligations that are both on our balance sheet and off balance sheet as of January 30, 2005 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods: Contractual Obligations | Total | | Within 1 Year | | 2-3 Years | 4-5 Years | | After 5 Years | ------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------+---------+---------------------+---+-----------------+-----------------+--------+---------------------+-- | (in thousands) | Capital lease obligations, including interest | $ | 869 | | $ | 869 | $ | -- | | $ | -- | $ | -- Operating leases | | 191,117 | | | 27,534 | | 54,847 | | | 52,942 | | 55,794Purchase obligations (1) | | 457,273 | | | 457,273 | | -- | | | -- | | -- Other liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under GAAP | | 4,375 | | | 2,000 | | 2,375 | | | -- | | -- Total contractual obligations | $ | 653,634 | | $ | 487,676 | $ | 57,222 | | $ | 52,942 | $ | 55,794 _________________ (1) Represents our inventory purchase commitments as of January 30, 2005.Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn March 2004, the FASB approved the consensus reached on the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 03-1, or EITF 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. EITF 03-1 provides guidance for identifying impaired investments and new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. On September 30, 2004, the FASB issued a final staff position EITF Issue 03-1-1 that delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance included in paragraphs 10 through 20 of EITF 03-1. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures required by EITF 03-1 remain effective for fiscal 2005. We do not believe the impact of adoption of this EITF consensus will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In November 2004, the FASB issued No. 151, or SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 amends ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provision of SFAS No. 151 shall be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 151 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   29 In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, or SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets — An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. SFAS No. 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 153 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), or SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based compensation payments. SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for all interim and annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 123(R) on our operating results and financial condition. The adoption of the SFAS No. 123(R) fair value method will have a significant impact on our reported results of operations, although it will have no impact on our overall financial position. The impact of adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) cannot be predicted at this time because that will depend on the fair value and number of share-based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) in prior periods, the magnitude of the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, assuming the application of the Black-Scholes model as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income (loss) and pro forma net income (loss) per share in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the subheading “Stock-Based Compensation.” SFAS No. 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. Business Risks  In addition to the risks discussed in “Item 1. Business” and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,"" our business is subject to the risks set forth below. Risks Related to Our Operations  Our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete inventory or, conversely, may result in inadequate inventory levels, either of which could adversely affect our financial results.  Inventory purchases are based upon future demand forecasts, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future. In forecasting demand, we must make multiple assumptions which may prove to be incorrect. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to write-down our inventory and our gross margin could be adversely affected. Additionally, if we fail to estimate customer demand properly before a new product is introduced, we may end up with excess inventory levels of older products, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory and our gross margin could be adversely affected. During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, demand for our non PCI Express mainstream desktop products declined significantly due in large part to unexpected competitive pricing actions taken by our competition. As a result of these competitive pricing actions, we were required to reduce the average selling prices of certain of our mainstream desktop products and our gross margin was adversely affected. If such competitive pricing actions were to recur in the future, we could be forced to continue to reduce average selling prices or to write-down our inventory and our gross margin could be adversely affected. Conversely, if we underestimate our customers’ demand for our products, we may have inadequate manufacturing capability and may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill our customers’ orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost effective manner. Inability to fill our customers' orders on a timely basis could damage our customer relationships, result in lost revenue, cause a loss in market share or damage our reputation.    30  We order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand. Therefore, we have limited ability to reduce our inventory purchase commitments quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls.  Substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long-term agreements. As a result, we may commit resources to the production of products without having received advance purchase commitments from customers. Any inability to sell products to which we have devoted significant resources could harm our business. In addition, cancellation or deferral of product orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could adversely affect our gross margin and restrict our ability to fund operations. We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth and in connection with selling workstation boards directly to major original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs. Additionally, because we typically recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to any revenue shortfalls. We could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory write-downs if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product demand. A reduction in demand could negatively impact our gross margin and financial results.  We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these employees could negatively impact our business.  Our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees. None of our officers or employees is bound by an employment agreement, meaning our relationships with our officers and employees are at will. We do not have ""key person"" life insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers, technical personnel or other key employees, particularly Jen-Hsun Huang, our President and Chief Executive Officer, would harm our business. Our success will depend on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. Our failure to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel would harm our business. The integration of new executives or personnel could disrupt our ongoing operations.  Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for existing and/or new products would reduce our gross margin.  Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function both of product design, which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer. Since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures, yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process. Resolution of yield problems would require cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer. Because of our potentially limited access to wafer fabrication capacity from our manufacturers, any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers. This could potentially harm customer relationships, our reputation, our revenue and our gross profit. Our wafer manufacturers may be unable to achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future. Our inability to achieve planned yields from our wafer manufacturers could harm our business. We also face the risk of product recalls or product returns resulting from design or manufacturing defects that are not discovered during the manufacturing and testing process. A significant number of product returns due to a defect or recall, could damage our reputation and result in customers working with our competitors.To stay competitive, we may have to invest more resources in research and development. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. We have substantially increased our engineering and technical resources and have 1,231 full-time employees engaged in research and development as of January 30, 2005, compared to 1,057 employees as of January 25, 2004. During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, research and development expenditures represented 17%, 15% and 12% as a percentage of revenue, respectively. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results would decline. We anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development. Research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue.   31 Our operating expenses are relatively fixed and we may have limited ability to reduce operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls. During fiscal 2005 and 2004, our operating expenses, which are comprised of research and development expenses and sales, general and administrative expenses, represented 27% and 24% of our total revenue, respectively. Since we typically recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to adjust our operating expenses in a timely manner in response to any revenue shortfalls. If we are unable to reduce operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls it would negatively impact our financial results.Failure to transition to new manufacturing process technologies could affect our ability to compete effectively. Our strategy is to utilize the most advanced manufacturing process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial third-party foundries. Use of advanced processes may have greater risk of initial yield problems and higher product cost. Manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development. We continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs. We currently use 0.15 micron, 0.14 micron, 0.13 micron and 0.11 micron process technologies for our family of GPUs, MCPs and WMPs. The majority of our newest GPUs, the GeForce 6 series, GeForce FX and the GeForce FX Go products are manufactured in 0.13 micron and 0.11 micron process technology.  We have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes in the past and, consequently, have suffered reduced yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels. We may face similar difficulties, delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes. Moreover, we are dependent on our relationships with our third-party manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully. The inability by us or our third-party manufacturers to transition to new manufacturing process technologies may adversely affect our operating results and negatively impact our gross margin.  Our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.  Many of our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict, and our operating expenses are largely independent of revenue in any particular period. It is, therefore, difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profits or losses. As a result, it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, perhaps substantially. For example, on August 5, 2004, we announced that the operating results for our second quarter of fiscal 2005 included significantly lower amounts of revenue and earnings per share than had been expected by securities analysts. Our announcement was followed by a decline in the trading price of our common stock. Conversely, on February 17, 2005, we announced better than expected financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. This announcement was followed by an increase in the price of our common stock. We believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue, gross profit and results of operations.  Factors that have affected our results of operations in the past, and could affect our results of operations in the future, include the following:   · | demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers’ products; --+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | the successful development and volume production of our next-generation products; --+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors; --+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------· | our ability to introduce new products in accordance with OEMs’ design requirements and design cycles; --+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our customers’ products; --+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | the level of growth or decline of the PC industry in general; --+----------------------------------------------------------------------   32  · | slower than expected growth of demand for new technologies; --+------------------------------------------------------------------· | fluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or manufacturing yields; --+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | declines in spending by corporations and consumers related to perceptions regarding an economic downturn in the United States and international economies; --+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices; --+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues; --+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | the rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders; --+-----------------------------------------------------------· | the loss of a key customer or the termination of a strategic relationship; --+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | seasonal fluctuations associated with the PC and consumer products market; --+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | substantial disruption in our suppliers’ operations, as a result of a natural disaster, equipment failure, terrorism or other causes; --+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our customers’ products, including memory devices; --+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | our inability to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products; --+-----------------------------------------------------------------------· | legal and other costs related to defending intellectual property and other types of lawsuits; --+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | availability of licenses at commercially reasonable terms for the continued sale or development of new products; --+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | customer receivable bad debt write-offs; --+-----------------------------------------------· | costs associated with the repair and replacement of defective products; --+------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | unexpected inventory write-downs; and --+--------------------------------------------· | introductions of enabling technologies to keep pace with faster generations of processors and controllers. --+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. In addition, the results of any quarterly period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year.  Risks Related to Our Products  We need to develop new products and to manage product transitions in order to succeed.  Our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to successfully develop new products for our target segments. Our add-in board and motherboard manufacturers, original design manufacturers, or ODMs, and major OEM customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year, typically based on spring and fall design cycles. Accordingly, when our customers are making their design decisions, our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products in order to be included in new system configurations. This requires that we do the following: · | anticipate the features and functionality that consumers will demand; --+----------------------------------------------------------------------------· | incorporate those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting design requirements of OEMs, ODMs, CEMs and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers; --+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | price our products competitively; and --+--------------------------------------------   33  · | introduce the products to the market within the limited window for OEMs, ODMs and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers. --+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ If ODMs and OEMs do not include our products in their systems, they will typically not use our products in their design systems until at least the next design configuration. Therefore, we endeavor to develop close relationships with our OEMs and ODMs in an attempt to allow us to better anticipate and address customer needs in new products.  As a result, we believe that significant expenditures for research and development will continue to be required in the future. We make these expenditures independent of the level of purchase commitments from our customers. If our new products are not adopted by our customers, our business results may be adversely affected. The success of new product introductions will depend on many factors, including the following:   · | proper new product definition; --+-------------------------------------· | timely completion and introduction of new product designs; --+-----------------------------------------------------------------· | the ability of IBM, TSMC, UMC, Chartered and any additional third-party manufacturers to effectively manufacture our new products in a timely manner; --+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | dependence on third-party subcontractors for assembly, testing and packaging of our products and in meeting product delivery schedules and maintaining product quality; --+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | the quality of any new products; --+---------------------------------------· | differentiation of new products from those of our competitors; --+---------------------------------------------------------------------· | market acceptance of our products and our customers' products; and --+-------------------------------------------------------------------------· | availability of adequate quantity and configurations of various types of memory products. --+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ A critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computer aided design, or CAD, industry. We have invested significant resources to develop relationships with industry leaders, including Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and Synopsys, Inc., often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products. We believe that forming these relationships and utilizing next-generation development tools to design, simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3D graphics, communications and networking markets and develop products that utilize leading-edge technology on a rapid basis. We believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of PC OEMs and cellular phone manufacturers. If these relationships are not successful, we may not be able to develop new products in a timely manner, which could result in a loss of market share, a decrease in revenue and a negative impact on our operating results.  In addition, our strategy includes utilizing the most advanced semiconductor process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial third-party foundries. Use of advanced processes has in the past resulted in initial yield problems. New products that we introduce may not incorporate the features and functionality demanded by OEMs, ODMs, add-in board and motherboard manufacturers and consumers of PCs and consumer electronics. Even if we are able to provide the demanded features and functionality, we may not be able to successfully develop or introduce new products in sufficient volumes within the appropriate time to meet both the OEMs’ design cycles and market demand. We have in the past experienced delays in the development of some new products. Our failure to successfully develop, introduce or achieve market acceptance for new digital media processors would harm our business. In particular, during the first half of fiscal 2004, we experienced delays in the introduction of digital media processors using our next generation technology. In addition, we expected to ramp up sales of our PCI Express products during the second quarter of fiscal 2005, but as a result of Intel’s delayed PCI Express chipset production, followed by their product recall, the performance desktop segment was impacted by stalling our customers’ production ramp of our GeForce PCX GPUs. Any such delay in the future or failure of our digital media processors or other processors to meet or exceed specifications of competitive products could materially harm our business.    34 Our failure to identify new market or product opportunities or develop new products could harm our business.  As our digital media processors develop and competition increases, we anticipate that product life cycles at the high end will remain short and average selling prices will continue to decline. In particular, we expect average selling prices and gross margins for our digital media processors to decline as each product matures and as unit volume increases. As a result, we will need to introduce new products and enhancements to existing products to maintain overall average selling prices and gross margins. In order for our digital media processors to achieve high volumes, leading PC OEMs, ODMs, and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers must select our digital media processor for design into their products, and then successfully complete the designs of their products and sell them. We may be unable to successfully identify new product opportunities or to develop and bring to market new products in a timely fashion. In addition, we cannot guarantee that new products we develop will be selected for design into PC OEMs’, ODMs’, and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers’ products, that any new designs will be successfully completed or that any new products will be sold. As the complexity of our products and the manufacturing process for our products increases, there is an increasing risk that we will experience problems with the performance of our products and that there will be delays in the development, introduction or volume shipment of our products. We may experience difficulties related to the production of current or future products or other factors that may delay the introduction or volume sale of new products we develop. In addition, we may be unable to successfully manage the production transition risks with respect to future products. Failure to achieve any of the foregoing with respect to future products or product enhancements could result in rapidly declining average selling prices, reduced margins and reduced demand for products or loss of market share. In addition, technologies developed by others may render our digital media processors non-competitive or obsolete or result in our holding excess inventory, any of which would harm our business. PCI Express is central to our GPU as well as MCP strategies and the outcome of this strategy will impact our business.  PCI Express is expected to enable a new level of performance for high bandwidth applications like graphics and networking. The transition to PCI Express, which is extremely complex, is central to our GPU and MCP objectives this fiscal year. We initiated this transition by creating our GeForce PCX series of GPUs, using HSI technology. During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we executed on our strategy to deliver a full line of GPUs ready to support PCI Express chipsets. We expected to ramp up sales of our PCI Express products during the second quarter of fiscal 2005, but as a result of Intel’s delayed PCI Express chipset production, followed by their product recall, the performance desktop segment was impacted by stalling our customers’ production ramp of our GeForce PCX GPUs. During the third quarter of fiscal 2005, we announced and ramped up sales of the GeForce 6600 GT, GeForce 6600 and the GeForce 6200, our first native PCI Express GPUs. In May 2004, we announced the Mobile PCI Express Module Specification, or MXM. MXM was jointly developed by NVIDIA and leading notebook PC manufacturers in an effort to accelerate the adoption of PCI Express-based notebooks in all market segments. MXM is an open design specification that supports a wide range of graphics solutions from most GPU manufacturers, allowing system integrators maximum flexibility for build-to-order with various graphics solutions. MXM also serves as the primary delivery vehicle for our GeForce Go 6 series of GPUs. Industry adoption of PCI Express was slower than we expected during fiscal 2005 and there is no assurance that the adoption rate will increase during fiscal 2006. If our PCI Express compatible products do not meet consumer and/or customer demand or expectations, our business results could suffer. We could suffer a loss of market share if our products contain significant defects.  Products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or experience failures when introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released. We have in the past discovered defects and incompatibilities with customers’ hardware in certain of our products and may experience delays or loss of revenue to correct any new defects or incompatibilities in the future. Errors in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments could result in loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance, or loss of design wins. Our products typically go through only one verification cycle prior to beginning volume production and distribution. As a result, our products may contain defects or flaws that are undetected prior to volume production and distribution. If these defects or flaws exist and are not detected prior to volume production and distribution, we may be required to reimburse customers for costs to repair or replace the affected products in the field. We may also be required to incur additional research and development costs to find and correct the defect, which could divert the attention of our management and engineers from the development of new products. These costs could be significant and could adversely affect our business and operating results. We may also suffer a loss of reputation and/or a loss in our market share, either of which could materially harm our financial results.    35 Risks Related to Our Partners We sell our products to a small number of customers and our business could suffer by the loss of these customers.  We have only a limited number of customers and our sales are highly concentrated. Although a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue, their end customers include a large number of OEMs and system integrators throughout the world. Our sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading PC OEMs and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key CEMs, ODMs, motherboard and add-in board manufacturers. These design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by CEMs, ODMs, motherboard and add-in board manufacturers. Our distribution strategy is to work with a small number of leading independent CEMs, ODMs, motherboard manufacturers, add-in board manufacturers and distributors, each of which has relationships with a broad range of system builders and leading PC OEMs. Currently, we sell a significant majority of our digital media processors directly to distributors, CEMs, ODMs, motherboard and add-in board manufacturers, which then sell boards with our graphics processor to leading PC OEMs, retail outlets and to a large number of system builders. If we were to lose sales to our PC OEMs, CEMs, ODMs, motherboard and add-in board manufacturers and were unable to replace the lost sales with sales to different customers, or if they were to significantly reduce the number of products they order from us, our revenue may not reach or exceed the expected level in any period, which could harm our financial condition and our results of operations. Difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could result in significant charges against income, which could harm our business.  Our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers' businesses and to downturns in the economy and the industry. In addition, difficulties in collecting accounts receivable or the loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Accounts receivable owed by foreign customers may be difficult to collect. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. As of the end of fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 our allowance for doubtful accounts represented 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.2% of revenue for each fiscal quarter, respectively. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required which could adversely affect our operating results. We may have to record additional reserves or write-offs in the future, which could negatively impact our financial results. We depend on foundries and independent contractors to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements, which would harm our business.  We do not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. Our products require wafers manufactured with state-of-the-art fabrication equipment and techniques. We utilize TSMC, IBM, UMC and Chartered to produce our semiconductor wafers and utilize independent subcontractors to perform assembly, testing and packaging. Our wafer requirements represent a significant portion of the total production capacity at IBM. We depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields, and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis at acceptable prices. These manufacturers may be unable to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing or pricing requirements. We obtain manufacturing services on a purchase order basis. The foundries we use have no obligation to provide us with any specified minimum quantities of product. TSMC, IBM, UMC and Chartered fabricate wafers for other companies, including certain of our competitors, and could choose to prioritize capacity for other users, reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, or increase the prices that they charge us on short notice. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to reduced or eliminated deliveries, we could lose sales to customers, which would negatively impact our revenue and our reputation. Because the lead-time needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner could be several quarters, there is no readily available alternative source of supply for any specific product. In addition, the time and expense to qualify a new foundry could result in additional expense, diversion of resources or lost sales any of which would negatively impact our financial results. We believe that long-term market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with TSMC, IBM, UMC, Chartered and any other manufacturers we may use to ensure adequate product supply and competitive pricing to respond to customer demand. Any difficulties like these would harm our business.    36 We are dependent on third parties located outside of the United States for assembly, testing and packaging of our products, which reduces our control over the delivery and quantity of our products. Our digital media processors are assembled and tested by Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd., Amkor Technology Inc., STATS ChipPAC Incorporated and Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., all of which are located outside of the United States. We do not have long-term agreements with any of these subcontractors. As a result of our dependence on third-party subcontractors for assembly, testing and packaging of our products, we do not directly control product delivery schedules or product quality. Any product shortages, quality assurance problems or political instability outside of the United States could increase the costs of manufacture, assembly or testing of our products, which could cause our gross margin to decline. Due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assemblers and testers, we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third parties to assemble or test our products or components. Any such delays could result in a loss of reputation or a decrease in sales to our customers.  We rely on third-party vendors to supply tools to us for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop these products.  In the design and development of new products and product enhancements, we rely on third-party software development tools. While we currently are not dependent on any one vendor for the supply of these tools, some or all of these tools may not be readily available in the future. For example, we have experienced delays in the introduction of products in the past as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from digital media processors in the future may exceed the capabilities of the software development tools that are available to us. If the software development tools we use become unavailable or fail to produce designs that meet consumer demands, our business could suffer.  We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products and sell our products.  In the past we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products, services and technologies that we believed would help expand or enhance our products and services or help expand our distribution channels. We may enter into future acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, in order to complement or expand our current businesses or enter into a new business segment. If we do consider an acquisition, strategic alliance or joint venture, the negotiations could divert management’s attention as well as other resources. For any previous or future acquisition or investment, the following risks could impair our ability to grow our business and develop new products, and ultimately, could impair our ability to sell our products and may not lead to any improvements in our financial results:   · | difficulty in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business; --+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | disruption of our ongoing businesses; --+--------------------------------------------· | difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction; --+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | diversion of management’s attention from our business; --+-------------------------------------------------------------· | difficulty in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; --+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | disruption of or delays in ongoing research and development efforts; --+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------· | diversion of capital and other resources; --+------------------------------------------------· | assumption of liabilities; --+---------------------------------· | difficulties in entering into new markets in which we have limited or no experience and where competitors in such market segments have stronger positions; and --+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   37  · | impairment of relationships with employees and customers, or the loss of key employees as a result of any integration of new businesses and management personnel. --+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ In addition, the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash, shares of our common stock, the issuance of convertible debt securities or a combination of cash, convertible debt and common stock. If we pay a portion of the purchase price in cash, our cash reserves would be reduced. If the consideration is paid with shares of our common stock, or convertible debentures, the holdings of existing stockholders would be further diluted. We cannot forecast the number, timing or size of future acquisitions, or the effect that any such acquisitions might have on our operations or financial results.  The impact on our future revenue by Microsoft’s announcement that it has entered into an agreement with one of our competitors to develop technology for future Xbox products and services is uncertain.  During fiscal 2004, Microsoft announced that it had entered into an agreement with one of our competitors to develop technology for future Xbox products and services. The impact that this announcement may have on our future revenue from Microsoft is uncertain, but we anticipate that we will not achieve historical levels of Xbox revenue in fiscal 2006. Revenue from Microsoft during fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 accounted for 13%, 15% and 23% respectively, of our total revenue. If our revenue from Microsoft declines during fiscal 2006, we will need to increase revenue from other customers in order to be able to maintain our current revenue level and operating results. If we do not replace any reduction in revenue from Microsoft with revenue from other customers, our operating results would be adversely affected. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control.  Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the following:   · | the ability of the board of directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior stockholder approval; --+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent; --+----------------------------------------------------------------· | a classified board of directors; and --+-------------------------------------------· | advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals. --+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. In the event that an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft has first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA.  Risks Related to Our Competition  The 3D graphics, platform processor and handheld industries are highly competitive and we may be unable to compete.  The market for GPUs, MCPs and WMPs for PCs and handhelds is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and distribution channels, backward-forward software support, conformity to industry standard Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, manufacturing capabilities, price of digital media processors and total system costs of add-in boards and motherboards. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality. We expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products, which could harm our business. Further, we expect substantial competition from Intel’s publicized focus on moving to selling platform solutions dominated by Intel products, such as the Centrino platform.   38 An additional significant source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide GPU and MCP solutions for the PC and WMP segments. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes. Our current competitors include the following:   · | suppliers of MCPs that incorporate a combination of 3D graphics, networking, audio, communications and Input/Output, or I/O, functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as ATI, Broadcom, Intel, Silicon Integrated Systems, Inc. and VIA; --+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | suppliers of standalone desktop GPUs that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as ATI, Creative Technology, Matrox Electronics Systems Ltd. and XGI Technology, Inc.; --+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | suppliers of standalone notebook GPUs that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as ATI, Silicon Motion Corporation and the joint venture of a division of SONICblue Incorporated (formerly S3 Incorporated) and VIA; and --+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | suppliers of WMPs for handheld devices that incorporate advanced graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as ATI, Renesas Technology, Broadcom and Seiko-Epson. --+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If and to the extent we offer products outside of the PC, consumer electronics and handheld segments, we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete. We cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter. If we are unable to compete in our current and any new markets, our financial results will suffer. Our failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our business.  Our future success will depend in large part on achieving design wins, which entails having our existing and future products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by PC OEMs, ODMs, and add-in board and motherboard manufacturers. Our add-in board and motherboard manufacturers and major OEM and ODM customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year, generally based on spring and fall design cycles. Accordingly, at the time our OEM and ODM customers are making their decisions, our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products with such performance characteristics, consistent quality, correct price and an adequate feature-set in order to be included in new system configurations. Our failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our business. The process of being qualified for inclusion in an OEM’s product can be lengthy and could cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end users for a particular product feature, which also could harm our business. Even if we achieve a significant number of design wins, there can be no assurance that our OEM and ODM customers will actually take the design to production or that the design will be commercially successful.  Our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards. Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers, including Intel and Microsoft. Such changes would require us to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time, our ability to achieve design wins could suffer. If we are unable to achieve new design wins for existing or new customers, we may lose market share and our operating results would be negatively impacted.     39 Risks Related to Market Conditions  We are dependent on the PC market and the rate of its growth has and may in the future have a negative impact on our business.  We derive the majority of our revenue from the sale of products for use in the desktop PC and notebook PC segments, including professional workstations. We expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from the sale or license of products for use in the desktop PC and notebook PC segments in the next several years. A reduction in sales of PCs, or a reduction in the growth rate of PC sales, will reduce demand for our products. Moreover, changes in demand could be large and sudden. Since PC manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they have incorrectly forecast product transitions. In these cases, PC manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until the excess inventory has been absorbed.  If our products do not continue to be accepted by the PC and consumer electronics segments or if demand by the PC and consumer electronics segments for new and innovative products decreases, our business and operating results would suffer.  Our success depends in part upon continued broad adoption of our digital media processors for 3D graphics in PC and consumer electronics applications. The market for digital media processors has been characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products, often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results, changes in dynamic random-access memory devices pricing and other changes in the total system cost of add-in boards, as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions. Only a small number of products have achieved broad market acceptance and such market acceptance, if achieved, is difficult to sustain due to intense competition and frequent new technology and product introductions. Since the PC segment is our core business, our business would suffer if for any reason our current or future digital media processors do not continue to achieve widespread acceptance in the PC segment. If we are unable to complete the timely development of products or if we were unable to successfully and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver products that meet the requirements of the PC segment, we may experience a decrease in revenue which could negatively impact our operating results. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the industry will continue to demand new products with improved standards, features or performance. If our customers and the market do not continue to demand new products with increased performance, features, functionality or standards, sales of our products could decline and our business and operating results could suffer. We are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business.  A significant portion of our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third-parties located outside of the United States. Additionally, we generated 76% of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and other Americas for the fiscal 2005. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and other Americas for fiscal 2004 and 2003 accounted for 75% and 68% of total revenue, respectively. The manufacture, assembly, test and packaging of our products outside of the United States and sales to these customers outside of the United States and other Americas subjects us to a number of risks associated with conducting business outside of the United States and other Americas, including, but not limited to:   · | international economic and political conditions; --+-------------------------------------------------------· | unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements; --+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | labor issues in foreign countries; --+-----------------------------------------· | cultural differences in the conduct of business; --+-------------------------------------------------------· | inadequate local infrastructure; --+---------------------------------------· | delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; --+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | transportation delays; --+-----------------------------· | longer payment cycles; --+-----------------------------   40  · | difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; --+----------------------------------------------------· | fluctuations in currency exchange rates; --+-----------------------------------------------· | imposition of additional taxes and penalties; --+----------------------------------------------------· | different legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property; --+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------· | the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws; and --+-------------------------------------------------------------------· | other factors beyond our control, including terrorism, civil unrest, war and diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS and Bird flu. --+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If sales to any of our customers outside of the United States and other Americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may be negatively impacted.  We also have sales offices in several international locations including Taiwan, Russia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Germany, France and the United Kingdom. We have a design center in Germany and recently opened a design center in India. Our international operations are subject to the many of the risks contained in the above list. Difficulties with our international operations, including finding appropriate staffing, may divert management’s attention and other resources all of which could negatively impact our operating results. Currently, all of our arrangements with third-party manufacturers and subcontractors provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars as are sales to our customers located outside of the United States and other Americas. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which would negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. To date, we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities, although we may do so in the future. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future.Hostilities involving the United States and/or terrorist attacks could harm our business. The financial, political, economic and other uncertainties following the terrorist attacks upon the United States led to a weakening of the global economy. Subsequent terrorist acts and/or the threat of future outbreak or continued escalation of hostilities involving the United States and Iraq or other countries could adversely affect the growth rate of our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers, distributors and suppliers, which could also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  Our business is cyclical in nature and an industry downturn could harm our financial results.  Our business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, including alternating periods of overcapacity and capacity constraints, variations in manufacturing costs and yields, significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development and rapid technological change. If we are unable to respond to changes in our industry, which can be unpredictable and rapid, in an efficient and timely manner, our operating results could suffer. In particular, from time to time, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. If we cannot take appropriate actions such as reducing our costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand during a downturn, our revenue and earnings will suffer during downturns.  Political instability in Taiwan and in The People’s Republic of China or elsewhere could harm our business.  Because of our reliance on TSMC and UMC, our business may be harmed by political instability in Taiwan, including the worsening of the strained relations between The People’s Republic of China and Taiwan, or if relations between the United States and The People’s Republic of China are strained due to foreign relations events. If any of our suppliers experienced a substantial disruption in their operations, as a result of a natural disaster, political unrest, economic instability, acts of terrorism or war, equipment failure or other cause, could harm our business.    41 We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates.  We invest in a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of investments in commercial paper, money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations, municipalities and the United States government and its agencies. These investments are denominated in United States dollars.  We account for our investment instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 115. All of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as ""available-for-sale"" under SFAS No. 115. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Part of our portfolio includes equity investments in publicly traded companies, the value of which are subject to market price volatility. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded equity investments is judged to be other-than-temporary. We may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because our debt securities are classified as ""available-for-sale"", no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity.  Our stock price may continue to experience significant short-term fluctuations.  The price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly. These price fluctuations have been rapid and severe. For example, on August 5, 2004, we announced that the operating results for our second quarter of fiscal 2005 included significantly lower amounts of revenue and earnings per share than had been expected by securities analysts. Our announcement was followed by a decline in the trading price of our common stock. Conversely, on February 17, 2005, we announced better than expected financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. This announcement was followed by an increase in the price of our common stock. We believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue, gross profit and results of operations. The price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to factors that are non-company specific, such as the decline in the United States economy, acts of terror against the United States, war or due to a variety of company specific factors, including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results, shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and the other factors discussed in these risk factors. Risks Related to Intellectual Property, Litigation and Government Action  While we believe that we currently have adequate internal controls over financial reporting, we are exposed to risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate those internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2004 requires our management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. We have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements. This legislation is relatively new and neither companies nor accounting firms have significant experience in complying with its requirements. As a result, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur increased expense and to devote additional management resources to Section 404 compliance. In the event that our chief executive officer, chief financial officer or our independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under Section 404, investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock.  Expensing employee stock options in future periods will materially and aversely affect our reported operating results.Since inception, we have used stock options and our employee stock purchase program as fundamental components of our compensation packages. To date we generally have not recognized compensation cost for employee stock options or shares sold pursuant to our employee stock purchase program. We believe that these incentives directly motivate our employees and, through the use of vesting, encourage our employees to remain with us. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, or SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005, and requires that we record compensation expense for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan using the fair value of those awards. Expensing these incentives in future periods will materially and adversely affect our reported operating results as the stock-based compensation expense would be charged directly against our reported earnings. To the extent that SFAS No. 123(R) makes it more expensive to grant stock options or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program, we may decide to incur increased cash compensation costs. In addition, actions that we may take to reduce the non-cash expense may make it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees any of which could adversely affect our competitive position as well as our business and operating results.   42 We are currently involved in patent litigation, which, if not resolved favorably, could require us to pay damages. We are currently involved in patent litigation. On October 19, 2004, Opti Incorporated, or Opti, filed a complaint for patent infringement against us in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Opti asserts that unspecified NVIDIA chipsets infringe five United States patents held by Opti. Opti seeks unspecified damages for our conduct, attorneys fees and triple damages because of our alleged willful infringement of these patents. Discovery has not begun and no trial date has been set. We believe the claims asserted against us are without merit and we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously. In August 2004, a Texas limited partnership named American Video Graphics, LP, or AVG, filed three separate complaints for patent infringement against various corporate defendants (not including NVIDIA) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. AVG initially asserted that each of the approximately thirty defendants sells products that infringe one or more of seven separate patents that AVG claims relate generally to graphics processing functionality. Each of the three lawsuits targeted a different group of defendants; one case involves approximately twenty of the leading personal computer manufacturers, the PC Makers Case, one case involves the three leading video game console makers, the Game Console Case, and one case involves approximately ten of the leading video game publishers, the Game Publishers Case. In November 2004, NVIDIA sought and was granted permission to intervene in two of the three pending AVG lawsuits, the PC Makers Case and the Game Console Case. NVIDIA’s complaint in intervention alleges both that the patents in suit are invalid and that, to the extent AVG’s claims target NVIDIA products, the asserted patents are not infringed. Two other leading suppliers of graphics processing products, Intel and ATI, have also intervened in the cases, ATI in both the PC Makers and Game Console Case, and Intel in the PC Makers Case. After some consensual reconfigurations proposed by the various parties, in January 2005, the district court judge entered Docket Control and Discovery Orders in the three lawsuits. The PC Makers case now involves four separate patents and is currently scheduled for trial beginning on September 11, 2006. The Game Console Case involves a single patent and is currently scheduled for trial beginning on December 4, 2006. We believe that, to the extent AVG’s infringement allegations target functionality that may be performed by NVIDIA products, those claims are without merit, and we will continue to defend ourselves and our products vigorously. Our defenses against these suits may be unsuccessful. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the range of any loss or damages resulting from these suits due to uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome. If these cases go forward, we expect that they will result additional legal and other costs, regardless of the outcome, which could be substantial. Our industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions that could result in litigation and substantial costs to us.  The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions, which have resulted in protracted and expensive litigation. The digital media processor industry in particular has been characterized recently by the aggressive pursuit of intellectual property positions, and we expect our competitors to continue to pursue aggressive intellectual property positions. The technology that we use to design and develop our products and that is incorporated into our products may be subject to claims that it infringes the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Our success is dependent on our ability to develop new products without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of others. From time to time we receive notices or are included in legal actions alleging that we have infringed patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties. We expect that, as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases, and as competition in our product lines intensifies, the volume of intellectual property infringement claims may increase. If infringement claims are made against us, we may seek licenses under the claimants’ patents or other intellectual property rights. However, licenses may not be offered to us at all or on terms acceptable to us, particularly by competitors. The failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of and sale of one or more products, which could reduce our revenue and harm our business. Furthermore, we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights, which could be costly.    43 If we have to initiate a claim, our operating expenses may increase which could negatively impact our operating results. In order to develop products, we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in our digital media processors, and expect to continue to enter into license agreements with third parties for future products. These licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties, the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our competitive position and our business could suffer.  We have agreed to indemnify certain customers for certain claims of infringement arising out of sale of our products. We may be involved in future lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us or customers that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement arising out of the sale of our products to these customers. In addition, litigation or other legal proceedings may be necessary to:  · | assert claims of infringement; --+-------------------------------------· | enforce our patents; --+---------------------------· | protect our trade secrets or know-how; or --+------------------------------------------------· | determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the propriety rights of others. --+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be very costly and can divert management’s attention from other matters. We may be unsuccessful in defending or pursuing these lawsuits or claims. An unfavorable ruling could include significant damages, invalidation of a patent or group of patents, indemnification of customers, payment of lost profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief. If one of our patents in invalidated or found to be unenforceable, we would be unable to license the patent which could result in a loss of revenue. We or our customers may be required to obtain a license to the other parties’ patents or intellectual property. If we fail to obtain a license from a third party for technology we use or that is used by an indemnified customer, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture of and sale of one or more of our products either of which could reduce our revenue and harm our business. Initiation of claims or indemnification of a customer may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results. Our ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property.  We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. We have numerous patents issued, allowed and pending in the United States and in foreign countries. Our patents and pending patent applications relate to technology used by us in connection with our products, including our digital media processors. We also rely on international treaties and organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as by the laws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as: the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors’ operations in particular countries and regions; the location in which our products are manufactured; our strategic technology or product directions in different countries; and the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions. Our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved. In addition, any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties. The enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business.

Revenue  During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we reorganized our operating segments to bring all major product groups in line with our strategy to position ourselves as the worldwide leader in programmable graphics processor technologies. We now report financial information for four product-line operating segments to our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, as follows: the GPU Business, the MCP Business, the Handheld GPU Business, and the Consumer Electronics Business. Revenue in the “All Other” category is primarily derived from sales of memory.  Please refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Fiscal 2005 was a 53-week year, compared to fiscal 2006 and 2004 which were 52-week years, and we believe that this extra week may have had a positive impact on our revenue in fiscal 2005. However, we are not able to quantify the effect of the slightly longer year on our revenue.Fiscal Year 2006 vs. Fiscal Year 2005 Revenue was $2.4 billion for fiscal 2006, compared to $2.0 billion for fiscal 2005, which represents an increase of 18.2%. A discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows: GPU Business. GPU Business revenue increased by 22.6% to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2006 compared to $1.4 billion for fiscal 2005. The increase was the result of increased sales of our GeForce 6 and GeForce 7 families of desktop GPUs that serve the high-end GPU segment, offset by a slight decline in sales of our mainstream GPU products. In addition, sales of our NVIDIA Quadro professional workstation products and notebook products continued to improve due to an increased mix of GeForce 6-based and GeForce 7-based products, which resulted in an increase in average selling prices. MCP Business. MCP Business revenue was $352.3 million for fiscal 2006, compared to $175.7 million for fiscal 2005, which represents an increase of 100.6%.  The overall increase in MCP Business revenue is primarily due to increased sales of NVIDIA nForce4 products, which we began selling during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, and an increase in average selling prices. The overall increase was offset by a decrease in sales of NVIDIA nForce3 and NVIDIA nForce2 products.   40   Handheld GPU Business. Handheld GPU Business revenue was $58.7 million for fiscal 2006, compared to $45.9 million for fiscal 2005, which represents an increase of 27.9%.  The overall increase in Handheld GPU Business revenue is due to an increase in average selling prices of high-end feature phone products and revenue recognized as a result of a development contract. Consumer Electronics Business. Consumer Electronics Business revenue was $170.2 million for fiscal 2006, compared to $260.0 million for fiscal 2005, which represents a decrease of 34.5%. The decrease in our Consumer Electronics Business is a result of decreased and discontinued sales of our Xbox-related products to Microsoft, partially offset by revenue recognized from our contractual arrangement with SCE. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Microsoft indicated that it would not order any more Xbox-related products from us after our second fiscal quarter. As a result, the second quarter of fiscal 2006 was the last quarter during which we recognized revenue from the sale of our Xbox-related products to Microsoft. During fiscal 2006, we recognized $49.0 million of revenue from our contractual arrangements with SCE to jointly develop a custom GPU incorporating our next-generation GeForce GPU and SCE’s system solutions in SCE’s PlayStation3. No such revenue was recognized during our fiscal 2005 as our definitive agreement with SCE was not executed until the first quarter of fiscal 2006.Fiscal Year 2005 vs. Fiscal Year 2004Revenue was $2.0 billion in fiscal 2005, compared to $1.8 billion in fiscal 2004, which represented an increase of 10.3%. Fiscal 2005 was a 53-week year, compared to fiscal 2004 which was a 52-week year. GPU Business. GPU Business revenue increased by 7.1% to $1.4 billion for fiscal 2005 compared to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily the result of increased sales of our NVIDIA Quadro professional workstation products in fiscal 2005, which was due to unit sales volume increases, and an increase in average selling prices as a result of increased board sales. Notebook GPU sales increased in fiscal 2005 as a result of sales of our GeForce FX Go notebook GPU products outpacing the decline in our older notebook GPU product lines during the period. Sales of desktop products increased in fiscal 2005 as a result of a significant increase in sales of our high-end desktop products, offset by a slight decrease in mainstream desktop products. High-end desktop sales increased in fiscal 2005 primarily due to unit volume increases primarily related to our GeForce 6800 and 6600 products. The decrease in mainstream desktop sales in fiscal 2005 was mainly due to competitive pricing in the mainstream segment offset by the ramp of product sales of our GeForce 6200 with TurboCache technology during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.MCP Business. MCP Business revenue increased by 8.1% to $175.7 million for fiscal 2005 compared to $162.4 million for fiscal 2004. The increase in MCP Business revenue is due to increased sales of NVIDIA nForce3 and NVIDIA nForce4 products. NVIDIA nForce4 products began selling during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. This increase was offset by a decrease in sales of NVIDIA nForce2 products.Handheld GPU Business. Handheld GPU Business revenue increased by 409.7% to $45.9 million for fiscal 2005 compared to $9.0 million for fiscal 2004. The increase in handheld GPU sales in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to our acquisition of MediaQ, Inc. in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, which represented our initial entry into the handheld segment and to sales of our GoForce 4000 product. Consumer Electronics Business. Consumer Electronics Business revenue decreased by 7.2% to $260.0 million for fiscal 2005 compared to $280.1 million for fiscal 2004. The decrease in our Consumer Electronics Business is due to unit sales volume increases offset by a lower average sales price. Sales of our Xbox products historically fluctuated based on the timing of orders from Microsoft.    41  Concentration of RevenueRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and other Americas accounted for 84%, 76% and 75% of total revenue for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign CEMs’, add-in board and motherboard manufacturers’ revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location. The increase in the percentage of revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and other Americas for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 and for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 is primarily due to decreased sales of XGPUs and MCPs used in the Microsoft Xbox product, which were billed to Microsoft in the United States. Sales to our two largest customers accounted for approximately 26%, 31%, and 36% of our revenue during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Gross Profit Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory provisions and shipping costs.  Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements. Gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue. Our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of products sold.  Our gross margin was 38.3%, 32.3% and 29.0% for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004. A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our operating segments is as follows: Fiscal Year 2006 vs. Fiscal Year 2005GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU Business increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to the sale of our GeForce 7 series GPUs and increased sales of our GeForce 6 series GPUs, which collectively now account for approximately 78% of our GPU Business revenue.  Our GeForce 7 and our GeForce 6 series GPUs generally have higher gross margins than our GeForce FX series GPUs which comprised 53% of our     42  fiscal 2005 GPU Business revenue. In addition, average selling prices from our notebook GeForce 7 and GeForce 6 series GPU products increased as a larger percentage of our total notebook revenue during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005.MCP Business. The gross margin of our MCP Business increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to the increase in revenue from sales of our NVIDIA nForce3 and NVIDIA nForce4 products, which to date have experienced higher gross margins than previous generations of NVIDIA nForce products.  Handheld GPU Business. The gross margin of our Handheld GPU Business increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to the inventory write-off of certain handheld products in the third quarter of fiscal 2005.Consumer Electronics Business. The gross margin of our Consumer Electronics Business increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to the reduction of die costs for Xbox-related products, and the recognition of revenue from our contractual arrangements with SCE to jointly develop a custom GPU incorporating our next-generation GeForce GPU and SCE’s system solutions in SCE’s PlayStation3.Fiscal Year 2005 vs. Fiscal Year 2004GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU Business increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. Our GeForce FX series of GPU products experienced lower gross margins than previous series of GeForce GPU products, such as the GeForce 4 series. Company-wide efforts were made to drive down cost and improve gross margin and, as a result, during fiscal 2005, we were able to improve our gross margin. In addition, in fiscal 2005, we realized increased sales of our performance GeForce FX desktop GPU products and began shipping our GeForce 6 series GPUs, which are among our highest gross margin products. Finally, revenue from our NVIDIA Quadro professional workstation products, which typically provide the highest gross margins of any of our products, increased as a percentage of our total revenue during fiscal 2005. This increase in our mix of revenue toward higher-margin products led to a positive impact on our overall gross margin.MCP Business. The gross margin of our MCP Business increased during the fiscal 2005 as compared fiscal 2004 primarily due to the increase in revenue from sales of our NVIDIA nForce3 and NVIDIA nForce4 products, which to date have experienced higher gross margins than our previous generations of NVIDIA nForce products.  Handheld GPU Business. The gross margin of our Handheld GPU Business decreased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to the inventory write-off of certain handheld products in the third quarter of fiscal 2004.Consumer Electronics Business. The gross margin of our Consumer Electronics Business decreased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to the pricing settlement with Microsoft that we announced on February 6, 2003 that related to sales of our Xbox related processors. In addition, during fiscal 2005 we realized a lower average sales price on our sales of Xbox processors. Consolidated Gross MarginThe improvement in our gross margin reflects our continuing focus on delivering cost effective product architectures, enhancing business processes and delivering profitable growth.  We expect gross margin to improve by approximately 0.5% to 1.0% during the first quarter of fiscal 2007.

Other expenses increased $3.9 million primarily due to travel and other employee related expenses associated with the     43  expansion of our international sites. Depreciation and amortization increased $2.1 million due to increased purchases of hardware and software equipment and facilities increased $0.6 million due to increased facilities expense allocation, both of which were based on the growth in headcount. These increases were offset by an increase of $26.9 million in license and development project costs, primarily related to increased development costs related to our collaboration with SCE and other engineering costs related to a different development contract. As a portion of our personnel who usually devote their time to research and development efforts have been focusing their efforts on these development projects, the costs associated with these individuals are not charged to research and development, but were charged to cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of income, or were capitalized on our consolidated balance sheets and will be recognized as cost of revenue, on a percentage of completion basis.Research and development expenses increased by $65.1 million, or 24%, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to a $36.0 million increase in salaries and benefits related to 174 additional personnel and a $10.4 million increase in new product development costs related to an overall increase in the number of product tape-outs and in prototype materials. Depreciation and amortization increased $11.5 million due to emulation hardware and software programs that were purchased during fiscal 2004, resulting in a full year of depreciation in fiscal 2005 compared to a partial year of depreciation in fiscal 2004. Computer software and equipment increased $4.2 million primarily due to increased allocation of information technology expenses and facilities increased $3.1 million due to increased facilities expense allocation, both of which were based on the growth in headcount. Other expenses increased $1.9 million primarily due to travel and other employee related expenses associated with the expansion of our international sites. These increases were offset by an increase of $2.0 million in license and development project costs related to our collaboration with SCE that are classified as cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of income, or were capitalized on our consolidated balance sheets and will be recognized on a percentage of completion basis. Our collaboration with SCE was not in effect during fiscal 2004. We anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development. Research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue.Sales, General and Administrative  | Year Ended | | | | | | Year Ended | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+-------+--------------------------+---+--------+---+----------------------------+-------+--------------------------+--------------------------+--- | Jan. 29, | | Jan. 30, | | $ | | % | | Jan. 30, | Jan. 25, | | $ | | % |  | 2006 | | 2005 | | Change | | Change | | 2005 | 2004 | | Change | | Change |  | (in thousands) | Sales, General and Administrative: | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Salaries and benefits | $ | 108.5 | | $ | 94.7 | | $ | 13.8 | | 15 | % | $ | 94.7 | | $ | 76.3 | | $ | 18.4 | | 24 | % Advertising and promotions | | 49.4 | | | 66.6 | | | (17.2 | ) | (26 | )% | | 66.6 | | | 47.2 | | | 19.4 | | 41 | % Legal and accounting fees | | 18.7 | | | 12.6 | | | 6.1 | | 48 | % | | 12.6 | | | 12.6 | | | -- | | -- | Facility expense | | 12.5 | | | 9.6 | | | 2.9 | | 30 | % | | 9.6 | | | 8.3 | | | 1.3 | | 16 | % Depreciation and amortization | | 8.5 | | | 13.0 | | | (4.5 | ) | (35 | )% | | 13.0 | | | 14.6 | | | (1.6 | ) | (11 | )%Other | | 6.8 | | | 4.3 | | | 2.5 | | 58 | % | | 4.3 | | | 6.2 | | | (1.9 | ) | (31 | )%Total | $ | 204.4 | | $ | 200.8 | | $ | 3.6 | | 2 | % | $ | 200.8 | | $ | 165.2 | | $ | 35.6 | | 22 | % Sales, general and administrative as a percentage of net revenue | | 9 | % | | 10 | % | | | | | | | 10 | % | | 9 | % | | | | | Sales, general and administrative expenses increased $3.6 million, or 2%, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to a $13.8 million increase in salaries and benefits related to 122 additional personnel and a $6.1 million increase     44  in legal expenses primarily due to certain insurance reimbursements that we received during fiscal 2005 that reduced this expense, and increased litigation activity during fiscal 2006 related to 3dfx Interactive, Inc., or 3dfx, and American Video Graphics, or AVG. In addition there were increases of $2.9 million in facility expense due primarily to the expansion of our international sites and $2.5 million in other general and administrative expenses, offset by a reduction in bad debt expense. These increases were offset by a $17.2 million decrease in advertising and promotion costs, primarily associated with a reduction in certain marketing programs, tradeshow expenses, new product launches and customer samples, other marketing costs, travel related and employee recruitment expenses, and by a $4.5 million decrease in depreciation and amortization. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased $35.6 million, or 22%, from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to an $18.4 million increase in salaries and benefits related to 88 additional personnel and a $19.4 million increase in advertising and promotion costs for tradeshows and new product launches and other marketing costs, including travel and customer samples. These increases were offset by a decrease of $1.9 million in other expenses during the period, including a reduction in bad debt expense. Operating ExpensesWe anticipate that our operating expenses will increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. In addition to the headcount additions that we plan to make, we will be adding the operating costs related to the acquisition of ULi, which closed on February 20, 2006. We expect that these factors will result in an increase in operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. In addition, the first quarter of fiscal 2007 will be the first time that we include stock-based employee compensation expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), or SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment in our results. We anticipate that our stock-based compensation expense will be approximately $18 to $22 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. In-process research and developmentIn connection with our acquisition of MediaQ in August 2003, we wrote-off $3.5 million of in-process research and development expense, or IPR&D, that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. In accordance with SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, as clarified by FIN 4, Applicability of SFAS No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method an interpretation of SFAS No. 2, amounts assigned to IPR&D meeting the above-stated criteria must be charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price.Settlement CostsSettlement costs were $14.2 million for fiscal 2006.  The settlement costs are associated with two litigation matters, 3dfx and AVG.  AVG is settled. The 3dfx matter is not finally settled and is subject to judicial review and the completion of appropriate procedures and documents. However, based on the potential settlement in this case, we have concluded that a loss is probable and that we can reasonably estimate the amount of loss.  Please refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.  Interest Income and Interest ExpenseInterest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income increased from $11.4 million to $20.7 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the result of higher average balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates in fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005. Interest income decreased from $18.6 million to $11.4 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the result of lower overall balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and due to lower market interest rates. Interest expense primarily consists of interest incurred as a result of capital lease obligations and, prior to the redemption in October 2003, interest on the convertible subordinated debentures, or the Notes. Interest expense decreased from $12.0 million to $0.2 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily due to the redemption of the Notes.   45  Other Income (Expense), net Other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities. Other income decreased by $1.1 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the liquidation of marketable securities during fiscal 2006 in order to obtain the cash needed for the repatriation of certain foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Other income decreased by $2.4 million from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 primarily due to $2.5 million of realized gains on the sale of marketable securities during fiscal 2004 as a result of our liquidation of a significant portion of our marketable securities portfolio in order to obtain the cash required to redeem the Notes in October 2003. This decrease was offset by a $1.0 million realized gain during fiscal 2005 related to the receipt of cash and marketable securities as part of an investment exchange. Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of $57.6 million, $25.1 million, and $12.3 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes, or our annual effective tax rate, was 16.0% in fiscal 2006, 20.0% in fiscal 2005, and 14.1% in fiscal 2004. The difference in the effective tax rates amongst the three years is primarily attributable to changes in our geographic mix of income subject to tax.  Please refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the components of our income tax expense. Convertible Debenture Redemption ExpenseOn October 24, 2003, we fully redeemed the Notes. The aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding was $300.0 million, which included $18.6 million of Notes that we had purchased in the open market during the three months ended October 26, 2003. The redemption price was equal to approximately 102.7% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. In connection with the redemption of the Notes, we recorded a one-time charge in fiscal 2004 of approximately $13.1 million, which included a $7.6 million redemption premium and $5.5 million of unamortized issuance costs.Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of January 29, 2006, we had $950.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $280.1 million from the end of fiscal 2005. As of January 30, 2005, we had $670.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $66.0 million from the end of fiscal 2004. Our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed by several financial institutions. Our investment policy requires the purchase of top-tier investment grade securities, the diversification of asset type and certain limits on our portfolio duration.  Operating activities generated cash of $446.4 million, $132.2 million, and $49.7 million during fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily related to the $202.2 million increase in net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities. On our consolidated balance sheet, accrued liabilities increased $77.2 million primarily due to the recording of income taxes payable for fiscal 2006, the increase in accruals related to customer programs and the recording of $30.6 million in relation to 3dfx, of which $25.0 million was recorded as an adjustment to goodwill. Accounts payable decreased $58.8 million and inventories decreased $60.7 million primarily as a result of significant reductions in older products, offset by an increase in new products. Accounts receivable increased $21.9 million primarily due to increased sales and improved linearity of sales, and cash collections during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2005 when compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily related to the $25.9 million increase in net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities. On our consolidated balance sheet, accrued liabilities increased $37.3 million     46  primarily due to an increase in rebates payable, which resulted from increased OEM business. Accounts payable increased $52.9 million primarily due to purchases from subcontract manufacturers for inventory. Offsetting these increases, our accounts receivable increased $99.6 million primarily due to increased sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases and sales of marketable securities, and purchases of property and equipment, which include leasehold improvements for our facilities, and intangible assets. Investing activities used cash of $41.8 million and $152.0 million during fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2006 was primarily due to $79.6 million for capital expenditures primarily attributable to purchases of new research and development equipment, hardware equipment, technology licenses, software, intangible assets and leasehold improvements at our headquarters facility in Santa Clara, California and at our international sites. In addition, we used cash of $12.1 million to acquire certain assets of a private company and $9.7 million related to investments we made during fiscal 2006 in non-affiliated companies. These uses of cash were offset by $59.6 million of net proceeds from sales of marketable securities. Investing activities used cash of $152.0 million and provided cash of $88.0 million during fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2005 was primarily due to $84.7 million of net purchases of marketable securities. In addition, we used $67.3 million for capital expenditures primarily attributable to purchases of leasehold improvements for our new data center at our headquarters campus, new research and development emulation equipment, technology licenses, software and intangible assets. We expect to spend approximately $80 million to $100 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2007, primarily for purchases of software licenses, emulation equipment, computers and engineering workstations. In addition, we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets.  Financing activities used cash of $61.4 million during fiscal 2006 compared to cash provided of $13.8 million during fiscal 2005. Cash used in fiscal 2006 primarily resulted from $188.5 million related to our stock repurchase program, offset by $127.5 million of common stock issued under employee stock plans. In fiscal 2005, the cash provided was primarily from $42.5 million of common stock issued under employee stock plans, offset by $24.6 million related to our stock repurchase program. Financing activities provided cash of $13.8 million during fiscal 2005 compared to cash used of $270.3 million during fiscal 2004. Cash provided in fiscal 2005 primarily resulted from $42.5 million of common stock issued under employee stock plans, offset by $24.6 million related to our stock repurchase program. In fiscal 2004, the cash used was primarily due to the $300.0 million redemption of the Notes, which included $18.6 million of Notes that we had purchased during the three months ended October 26, 2003. Stock Repurchase Program On August 9, 2004 we announced that our Board of Directors, or the Board, had authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of our common stock, subject to certain specifications, up to an aggregate maximum amount of $300.0 million. As part of our share repurchase program, we have entered into and we may continue to enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions. These agreements generally require that we make an up-front payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock, within a pre-determined range, at the end of the term of the agreement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our common stock for $50.0 million under a structured share repurchase transaction, which we recorded on the trade date of the transaction. Through the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we have repurchased 8.5 million shares under our stock repurchase program for a total cost of $213.2 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we entered into a structured share repurchase transaction to repurchase shares of our common stock for $50.0 million that we expect to settle prior to the end of our first fiscal quarter. On March 6, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved an increase in our existing stock repurchase program. We announced a $400 million increase to the original stock repurchase program we had announced in August 2004. As a result of this increase, the amount of common stock the Board of Directors has authorized to be repurchased has now been increased to a total of $700 million. The repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured stock repurchase transactions, in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.      47  Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure RequirementsWe believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then-current stockholders. We also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures, which could harm our business. Factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and, as a result, our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include:· decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers’ products;  · inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next-generation products; · competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices; and · new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors. For additional factors see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Operations - Our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.” Shelf Registration StatementIn December 2003, we filed a Form S-3 with the SEC under its ""shelf"" registration process. This shelf registration was declared effective by the SEC on March 25, 2004. Under this shelf registration statement, we may sell common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, stock purchase contracts and/or stock purchase units in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of $500.0 million. Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, we intend to use the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. 3dfx Asset PurchaseThe 3dfx asset purchase closed on April 18, 2001. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the cash consideration due at the closing was $70.0 million, less $15.0 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a Credit Agreement dated December 15, 2000. The Asset Purchase Agreement also provided, subject to the other provisions thereof, that if 3dfx properly certified that all its debts and other liabilities had been provided for, then we would have been obligated to pay 3dfx two million shares of NVIDIA common stock. If 3dfx could not make such a certification, but instead properly certified that its debts and liabilities could be satisfied for less than $25.0 million, then 3dfx could have elected to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and a reduced number of shares of our common stock, with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by $25.00 per share. If 3dfx could not certify that all of its debts and liabilities had been provided for, or could not be satisfied, for less than $25.0 million, we would not be obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets. In October 2002, 3dfx filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. In March 2003, we were served with a complaint filed by the Trustee appointed by the Bankruptcy Court which sought, among other things, payments from us as additional purchase price related to our purchase of certain assets of 3dfx. In early November 2005, after many months of mediation, NVIDIA and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of 3dfx reached a conditional settlement of the Trustee’s claims against NVIDIA. This conditional settlement, which will be subject to the review and approval of the Bankruptcy Court, calls for a payment of approximately $30.6 million to the 3dfx estate. Under the settlement, $5.6 million relates to various administrative expenses and Trustee fees, and $25.0 million relates to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx. As such, during the three months ended October 30, 2005, we recorded $5.6 million as a charge to settlement costs and $25.0 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx. Please refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this litigation.    48  Contractual Obligations The following summarizes our contractual obligations that are not on our balance sheet as of January 29, 2006 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods: Contractual Obligations | Total | | Within 1 Year | | 2-3 Years | 4-5 Years | | After 5 Years | ----------------------------------------------+--------------------------------+---------+-------------------------------+---+---------------------------+---------------------------+--------+-------------------------------+-- | (in thousands) | Operating leases | $ | 172,483 | | $ | 29,557 | $ | 57,717 | | $ | 55,606 | $ | 29,603Purchase obligations (1) | | 401,571 | | | 401,571 | | -- | | | -- | | -- Total contractual obligations | $ | 574,054 | | $ | 431,128 | $ | 57,717 | | $ | 55,606 | $ | 29,603(1) Represents our inventory purchase commitments as of January 29, 2006.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K 303(a)(4)(ii).Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), or SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based compensation payments. In April 2005, the SEC delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R), which is now effective for annual periods that begin after June 15, 2005. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, or SAB No. 107, which includes interpretive guidance for the initial implementation of SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R) allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition. We intend to adopt SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method, which requires the application of the accounting standard as of January 30, 2006, the first day of our fiscal 2007. Expensing these incentives in future periods will materially and adversely affect our reported operating results as the stock-based compensation expense would be charged directly against our reported earnings. We anticipate that our stock-based compensation expense will be approximately $18 to $22 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and we are unsure how the market will react to this adverse affect on our operating results, which could impact our stock price. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we transitioned from a Black-Scholes model to a binomial model for calculating the estimated fair value of new stock-based compensation awards granted under our stock option plans. As a result of recent regulatory guidance, including SAB No. 107, and in anticipation of the impending effective date of SFAS No. 123(R), we reevaluated the assumptions we use to estimate the value of employee stock options and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan, beginning with stock options granted and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan in our first quarter of fiscal 2006. We determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and, therefore, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. Additionally, in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we began segregating options into groups for employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to make full use of the capabilities of the binomial valuation model. As such, the expected term is based on detailed historical data about employees' exercise behavior, vesting schedules, and death and disability probabilities. We believe the resulting binomial calculation provides a more refined estimate of the fair value of our employee stock options. For our employee stock purchase plan, we decided to continue to use the Black-Scholes model to calculate the estimated fair value.In June 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, or SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. SFAS No. 154 applies to all voluntary changes     49  in accounting principle, and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. We will adopt SFAS 154 during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 154 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2005, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force’s, or EITF’s, Issue No. 05-06, or EITF No. 05-06, Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements. EITF No. 05-06 provides that the amortization period used for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased after the inception of a lease be the shorter of (a) the useful life of the assets or (b) a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are reasonably assured upon the acquisition or the purchase. The provisions of EITF No. 05-06 are effective on a prospective basis for leasehold improvements purchased or acquired. We adopted EITF No. 05-06 during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In November 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position, or FSP, FAS115-1/124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, which addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. This FSP also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. The guidance in this FSP amends SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and SFAS No. 124, Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit Organizations, and APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. We will adopt this FSP during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We do not believe the adoption of this FSP will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS123(R)-3, Transition Election to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards. This FSP requires an entity to follow either the transition guidance for the additional-paid-in-capital pool as prescribed in SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, or the alternative transition method as described in the FSP. An entity that adopts SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective application may make a one-time election to adopt the transition method described in this FSP. An entity may take up to one year from the later of its initial adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) or the effective date of this FSP to evaluate its available transition alternatives and make its one-time election. This FSP became effective in November 2005. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this FSP could have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows."

The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.  We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.     35   Revenue RecognitionProduct Revenue We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured. For most sales, we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement. We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. At the point of sale, we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured. If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured, we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment.  Our policy on sales to distributors is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is recognized. Our customer programs primarily involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets. We account for rebates in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 01-9, or EITF 01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products) and, as such, we accrue for 100% of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor. Rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale, unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate. Unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue upon expiration of the rebate.  Our customer programs also include marketing development funds, or MDFs. We account for MDFs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense in accordance with EITF 01-9. MDFs represent monies paid to retailers, system builders, OEMs, distributors and add-in card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. If market conditions decline, we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered. We also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.  License and Development Revenue For license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components, we generally recognize this license revenue using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting over the period that services are performed. For all license and service arrangements accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method, we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project. We periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate. A provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. To date, we have not recorded any such losses. Costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts. If the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized, the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue. Revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress. Significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours. Any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period. Accounts Receivable We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Management determines this allowance, which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on general estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are covered by credit insurance and letters of credit. If the financial condition of our customers, the financial institutions providing letters of credit, or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain credit insurance in the future. Our current credit insurance agreement expires on December 31, 2007.     36   As of January 28, 2007, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $1.3 million and our gross accounts receivable balance was $534.4 million. Of the $534.4 million, $150.3 million was covered by credit insurance and $19.8 million was covered by letters of credit. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required and we may have to record additional reserves or write-offs on certain sales transactions in the future. As a percentage of our gross accounts receivable balance, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between 0.2% and 0.4% during fiscal years 2007 and 2006. Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables, the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit. As of January 28, 2007, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented 0.2% of our gross accounts receivable balance. If our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balance had been recorded at the high end of the range, at 0.4% of our gross receivable balance, then our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balance at January 28, 2007, would have been approximately $2.4 million, rather than the actual balance of $1.3 million. InventoriesInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis; which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We write down our inventory for estimated lower of cost or market, obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand, future product purchase commitments, estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, or if our future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted future demand for such products, additional future inventory write-downs may be required that could adversely affect our operating results. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may have higher gross margins when products are sold. Sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on our gross margin. As of January 28, 2007, our inventory reserve was $39.7 million. As a percentage of our gross inventory balance, our inventory reserve has ranged between 8.9% and 15.9% during fiscal years 2007 and 2006. As of January 28, 2007, our inventory reserve represented 10.1% of our gross inventory balance. If our inventory reserve balance had been recorded at the high end of the range, at 15.9% of our gross inventory balance, then our inventory reserve balance at January 28, 2007, would have been approximately $62.8 million, rather than the actual balance of $39.7 million. Inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped.Income Taxes  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, or SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, we recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We also recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.  United States income tax has not been provided on earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested.  Our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements, accordingly.  As of January 28, 2007, we had a valuation allowance of $68.6 million. Of the total valuation allowance, $3.7 million relates to state tax attributes acquired in certain acquisitions for which realization of the related deferred tax assets was determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to potential utilization limitations as a result of stock ownership changes, and $64.9 million relates to state deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain acquisitions becomes probable, recognition of these acquired tax benefits would first reduce goodwill to zero, then reduce other non-current intangible assets related to the acquisition to zero with any remaining benefit reported as a reduction to income tax expense. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to state tax benefits becomes probable, we would recognize an income tax benefit in the period such asset is more likely than not to be realized.    37   As of January 28, 2007, with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), or SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, we have derecognized both deferred tax assets for the excess of tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, reflected in our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards, and the offsetting valuation allowance. Consistent with prior years, the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards, in the amount of $344.9 million as of January 28, 2007, will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders’ equity, if and when realized. In determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized, we have elected to do so on a “with-and-without” approach with respect to such excess tax benefits. We have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stock-based compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes, and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from continuing operations. Goodwill Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value.  We determined that our reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments for the purposes of completing our Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, impairment test.  We utilize a two-step approach to testing goodwill for impairment. The first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair value-based test. In computing fair value of our reporting units, we use estimates of future revenues, costs and cash flows from such units. The second step, if necessary, measures the amount of such an impairment by applying fair value-based tests to individual assets and liabilities. We elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We completed our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and concluded that there was no impairment. However, future events or circumstances may result in a charge to earnings in future periods due to the potential for a write-down of goodwill in connection with such tests. Stock-based CompensationEffective January 30, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) which establishes accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. Accordingly, stock-based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the awards, and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period. Stock-based compensation expense recognized during fiscal 2007 was $116.7 million, which consisted of stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and our employee stock purchase plan. Please refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.We elected to adopt the modified prospective application method beginning January 30, 2006 as provided by SFAS No. 123(R). We recognize stock-based compensation expense using the straight-line attribution method. We estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a lattice-binomial model. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we recorded stock-based compensation expense equal to the amount that would have been recognized if the fair value method was used, for the purpose of the pro forma financial information provided in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, or SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosures. At the beginning of fiscal 2006, we transitioned from a Black-Scholes model to a binomial model for calculating the estimated fair value of new stock-based compensation awards granted under our stock option plans. The determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, vesting schedules, death and disability probabilities, expected volatility and risk-free interest. Our management determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and, therefore, could reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts. We began segregating options into groups for employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation model.Using the lattice-binomial model, the fair value of the stock options granted under our stock option plans have been estimated using the following assumptions during the year ended January 28, 2007:  Weighted average expected life of stock options (in years) | 3.6 - 5.1 | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------+--Risk free interest rate | 4.7% - 5.1 | %Volatility | 39% - 51 | %Dividend yield | — |    38      For our employee stock purchase plan we continue to use the Black-Scholes model. The fair value of the shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan has been estimated using the following assumptions during year ended January 28, 2007:  Weighted average expected life of stock options (in years) | 0.5 - 2.0 | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------+--Risk free interest rate | 1.6% - 5.2 | %Volatility | 30% - 47 | %Dividend yield | — |      SFAS No. 123(R) also requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience. If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of SFAS No. 123(R) in future periods, the compensation expense that we record under SFAS No. 123(R) may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period. Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs  From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If that occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigations may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. Results of OperationsThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue.    | Year Ended | ----------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+------ | January 28, 2007 | | January 29, 2006 | January 30, 2005 | Revenue | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %Cost of revenue | | 57.6 | | 61.7 | | 67.8 | Gross profit | | 42.4 | | 38.3 | | 32.2 | Operating expenses: | | | | | | | Research and development | | 18.0 | | 15.0 | | 17.3 | Sales, general and administrative | | 9.6 | | 8.5 | | 10.2 | Settlement costs | | - | | 0.6 | | - | Total operating expenses | | 27.6 | | 24.1 | | 27.5 | Income from operations | | 14.8 | | 14.2 | | 4.7 | Interest and other income, net | | 1.3 | | 0.8 | | 0.6 | Income before income tax expense | | 16.1 | | 15.0 | | 5.3 | Income tax expense | | 1.5 | | 2.3 | | 0.9 | Net income | | 14.6 | % | 12.7 | % | 4.4 | %    39   Fiscal Years Ended January 28, 2007, January 29, 2006, and January 30, 2005.  Revenue We report financial information for four product-line operating segments to our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, as follows: the GPU Business, the MCP Business, the Handheld GPU Business, and the Consumer Electronics Business. Revenue in the ""All Other"" category is primarily derived from sales of memory devices.  Please refer to Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Fiscal 2005 was a 53-week year, compared to fiscal years 2007 and 2006 which were 52-week years, and we believe that this extra week may have had a positive impact on our revenue in fiscal 2005.  However, we are not able to quantify the effect of the slightly longer year on our fiscal 2005 revenue.   Fiscal Year 2007 vs. Fiscal Year 2006Revenue was $3.07 billion for fiscal 2007, compared to $2.38 billion for fiscal 2006, which represents an increase of 29.2%. A discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows:  GPU Business. GPU Business revenue increased by 20.3% to $1.99 billion for fiscal 2007, compared to $1.66 billion for fiscal 2006. The increase was a result of increased sales of our desktop GPU products, notebook products and our NVIDIA professional workstation products. The increase in sales of our desktop GPU products was led by our GeForce 7-based and GeForce 8-based products that serve the high-end segment. Sales of our NVIDIA notebook products improved due to an increased mix of GeForce 7-based products, shipping for notebook PC design wins based on Intel’s Napa platform. This increase in sales was slightly offset by a decrease in average selling prices. Our NVIDIA professional workstation product sales increased due to an increase in unit shipments, offset by a slight decrease in average selling prices. MCP Business. MCP Business revenue was $661.5 million for fiscal 2007, compared to $352.3 million for fiscal 2006, which represents an increase of 87.8%. The overall increase in MCP business revenue is primarily due to sales of newer NVIDIA nForce4 products, NVIDIA nForce5 products, integrated AMD-based desktop products, and integrated Intel-based desktop products, which began shipping after the second quarter of fiscal 2007. In addition, revenue also increased as a result of our acquisition of ULi in February 2006.  Handheld GPU Business. Handheld GPU Business revenue was $108.5 million for fiscal 2007, compared to $58.7 million for fiscal 2006, which represents an increase of 84.7%. The overall increase in Handheld GPU Business revenue is due to an increase in unit sales of high-end feature cellular phone and PDA products. Consumer Electronics Business. Consumer Electronics Business revenue was $96.3 million for fiscal 2007, compared to $167.4 million for fiscal 2006, which represents a decrease of 42.5%. This decrease is a result of discontinued sales of our Xbox-related products to Microsoft, partially offset by revenue recognized from our contractual development arrangements. We recognized revenue from the sale of our Xbox-related products to Microsoft for the last time during the second quarter of fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, we recognized $92.9 million of revenue from our contractual arrangements with SCE for its PlayStation3, compared to $49.0 million of revenue recognized during fiscal 2006.  For the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we expect a seasonal decline associated with the PC business. Although we believe our market and competitive position in each of our business units continues to be strong, there are no significant industry growth drivers to offset seasonality. Microsoft’s next generation operating system, Microsoft Windows Vista, or Vista, has shipped. We believe that Vista is the first operating system to present, as a standard, the power of the GPU to all applications and that, in the future, a significant percentage of PCs will have Vista. With Vista, DX10, and HD/Blu-ray DVD as the technologies for PCs for the coming year, we believe that 3D graphics will become a central part of the computing experience and that the GPU will be more important than ever. However, to date we have not seen a significant impact from the launch of Vista.Fiscal Year 2006 vs. Fiscal Year 2005Revenue was $2.38 billion for fiscal 2006, compared to $2.01 billion for fiscal 2005, which represents an increase of 18.2%. A discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows:  GPU Business. GPU Business revenue increased by 22.9% to $1.66 billion for fiscal 2006 compared to $1.35 billion for fiscal 2005. The increase was the result of increased sales of our GeForce 6 and GeForce 7 families of desktop GPUs that serve the high-end GPU segment, offset by a slight decline in sales of our mainstream GPU products. In addition, sales of our NVIDIA Quadro professional workstation products and notebook products continued to improve due to an increased mix of GeForce 6-based and GeForce 7-based products, which resulted in an increase in average selling prices.      40  MCP Business. MCP Business revenue was $352.3 million for fiscal 2006, compared to $175.7 million for fiscal 2005, which represents an increase of 100.6%. The overall increase in MCP Business revenue is primarily due to increased sales of NVIDIA nForce4 products, which we began selling during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, and an increase in average selling prices. The overall increase was offset by a decrease in sales of NVIDIA nForce3 and NVIDIA nForce2 products.  Handheld GPU Business. Handheld GPU Business revenue was $58.7 million for fiscal 2006, compared to $45.9 million for fiscal 2005, which represents an increase of 27.9%. The overall increase in Handheld GPU Business revenue is due to an increase in average selling prices of high-end feature phone products and revenue recognized as a result of a development contract. Consumer Electronics Business. Consumer Electronics Business revenue was $167.4 million for fiscal 2006, compared to $260.0 million for fiscal 2005, which represents a decrease of 35.6%. The decrease in our Consumer Electronics Business is a result of decreased and discontinued sales of our Xbox-related products to Microsoft, partially offset by revenue recognized from our contractual arrangement with SCE. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Microsoft indicated that it would not order any more Xbox-related products from us after our second fiscal quarter. As a result, we recognized revenue from the sale of our Xbox-related products to Microsoft for the last time during the second quarter of fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2006, we recognized $49.0 million of revenue from our contractual arrangements with SCE to jointly develop a custom GPU for SCE’s PlayStation3. No such revenue was recognized during our fiscal 2005 as our definitive agreement with SCE was not executed until the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Concentration of RevenueRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and other Americas accounted for 83.6%, 84.0% and 75.9% of total revenue for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs’, add-in board and motherboard manufacturers’ revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location. The increase in the percentage of revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and other Americas for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to discontinued sales of XGPUs and MCPs used in the Microsoft Xbox product during fiscal 2006, which were billed to Microsoft in the United States.   Sales to our significant customers accounted for approximately 12% of our total revenue from one customer during fiscal year 2007, 26% of our total revenue from two customers during fiscal year 2006, and 31% of our total revenue from two customers during fiscal year 2005.  Gross Profit  Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory provisions and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements. Gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue. Our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of products sold. Our gross margin was 42.4%, 38.3%, and 32.2% for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our operating segments is as follows: Fiscal Year 2007 vs. Fiscal Year 2006GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU Business increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to the sale of our GeForce 8 series GPUs and increased sales of our GeForce 7 series GPUs, which collectively accounted for approximately 70% of our GPU Business revenue. Our GeForce 8 and our GeForce 7 series GPUs generally have higher gross margins than our previous generations of GPUs.  MCP Business. The gross margin of our MCP Business decreased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to a shift in product mix to higher volumes of integrated AMD-based desktop products which have experienced lower gross margins than our discrete MCP products, and inventory reserves that we recorded as a charge to cost of revenue that primarily related to purchase commitments that we believed had exceeded future demand.    41      Handheld GPU Business. The gross margin of our Handheld GPU Business increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to an increase in unit sales of high-end feature cellular phone and PDA products which generally have higher gross margins than our previous Handheld GPU products.     Consumer Electronics Business. The gross margin of our Consumer Electronics Business increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to license and royalty revenue from our contractual development arrangements that have higher gross margins compared to the gross margin of Xbox products shipped in fiscal 2006.Fiscal Year 2006 vs. Fiscal Year 2005GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU Business increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to the sale of our GeForce 7 series GPUs and increased sales of our GeForce 6 series GPUs, which collectively accounted for approximately 78% of our fiscal 2006 GPU Business revenue. Our GeForce 7 and our GeForce 6 series GPUs generally have higher gross margins than our GeForce FX series GPUs which comprised 53% of our fiscal 2005 GPU Business revenue. In addition, average selling prices from our notebook GeForce 7 and GeForce 6 series GPU products increased as a larger percentage of our total notebook revenue during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005.  MCP Business. The gross margin of our MCP Business increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to the increase in revenue from sales of our NVIDIA nForce3 and NVIDIA nForce4 products, which to date have experienced higher gross margins than previous generations of NVIDIA nForce products.Handheld GPU Business. The gross margin of our Handheld GPU Business increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to the inventory write-off of certain handheld products in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. Consumer Electronics Business. The gross margin of our Consumer Electronics Business increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to the reduction of die costs for Xbox-related products, and the recognition of revenue from our contractual arrangements with SCE to jointly develop a custom GPU for SCE’s PlayStation3. Consolidated Gross MarginThe improvement in our gross margin reflects our continuing focus on delivering cost effective product architectures, enhancing business processes and delivering profitable growth. We expect gross margin to remain flat or improve slightly during the first quarter of fiscal 2008.

In-process research and development expense, or IPR&D, increased by $14.0 million as a result of our acquisitions of PortalPlayer and Hybrid Graphics during fiscal 2007. Depreciation and amortization increased $1.6 million due to emulation hardware and software programs that were purchased during fiscal 2006, resulting in a full year of depreciation in fiscal 2007 compared to a partial year of depreciation in fiscal 2006. Computer software and equipment increased $11.2 million primarily due to increased allocation of information technology expenses and facilities increased $6.4 million due to increased facilities expense allocation, both of which were based on the growth in headcount. New product development increased by $7.1 million as a result of costs related to an overall increase in the number of product tape-outs and in prototype materials. License and development project costs decreased by $10.5 million primarily due to the inversed impact of decreased development costs related to our collaboration with SCE and other engineering costs related to a different development contract. Certain of our personnel who usually devote their time to research and development efforts have spent time working on these development projects. The cost associated with the time these individuals spend working on development projects is allocated from research and development to cost of revenue or is capitalized on our balance sheet. During fiscal 2007, less time was spent working on development projects so less cost was allocated to cost of revenue or capitalized and, therefore, more cost remained in research and development. Other expenses increased $6.2 million primarily due to travel and other employee related expenses associated with the expansion of our international sites including our acquisitions of ULi and Hybrid Graphics. Research and development expenses increased by $8.9 million, or 3%, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to a $32.5 million increase in salaries and benefits related to 423 additional personnel and a $5.3 million increase in computer software and equipment primarily due to increased allocation of information technology expenses. Depreciation and amortization increased $2.1 million due to increased purchases of hardware and software equipment and facilities increased $0.6 million due to increased facilities expense allocation, both of which were based on the growth in headcount. Other expenses increased $3.9 million primarily due to travel and other employee related expenses associated with the expansion of our international sites. These increases were offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $8.2 million and an increase of $26.9 million in license and development project costs, primarily related to increased development costs related to our collaboration with SCE and other engineering costs related to a different development contract. Certain of our personnel who usually devote their time to research and development efforts have spent time working on these development projects. The cost associated with the time these individuals spend working on development projects is allocated from research and development to cost of revenue or is capitalized on our balance sheet. During fiscal 2006, more time was spent working on development projects so more cost was allocated to cost of revenue or capitalized and, therefore, less cost remained in research and development.  We anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development. Research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue.

Legal and accounting fees increased by $7.2 million primarily due to our internal review of historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of prior year financial results. Advertising and promotions increased by $14.1 million due to travel and other employee costs associated with our international expansion. These increases were offset by a decrease of $2.9 million in other expenses related to reimbursement from collection settlements. Sales, general and administrative expenses decreased $2.1 million, or 1%, from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to a a $17.2 million decrease in advertising and promotion costs, primarily associated with a reduction in certain marketing programs, tradeshow expenses, new product launches and customer samples, other marketing costs, travel related and employee recruitment expenses. In addition, stock-based compensation expense decreased by $5.9 million and depreciation and amortization decreased by $4.5 million. These decreases were offset by a $13.9 million increase in salaries and benefits related to 122 additional personnel and a $6.1 million increase in legal expenses primarily due to certain insurance reimbursements that we received during fiscal 2005 that reduced this expense, and increased litigation activity during fiscal 2006 related to 3dfx Interactive, Inc., or 3dfx, and American Video Graphics, LP, or AVG. In addition there were increases of $2.9 million in facility expense due primarily to the expansion of our international sites and $2.6 million in other general and administrative expenses, offset by a reduction in bad debt expense.  Operating Expenses  We anticipate that our operating expenses will be relatively flat in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. We believe that even with the additional expense from our acquisition of PortalPlayer, we may be able to keep operating expenses flat as we focus on expense controls and restrict headcount additions in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. In-process research and development In connection with our acquisition of Hybrid Graphics in March 2006 and PortalPlayer in January 2007, we wrote-off $0.6 million and $13.4 million, respectively, of IPR&D, that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. In accordance with SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, as clarified by FIN 4, Applicability of SFAS No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method an interpretation of SFAS No. 2, amounts assigned to IPR&D meeting the above-stated criteria must be charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price.  Settlement Costs  Settlement costs were $14.2 million for fiscal 2006. The settlement costs are associated with two litigation matters, 3dfx and AVG. AVG is settled. For further information about the 3dfx matter, please refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Income and Interest Expense  Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income increased from $20.7 million to $41.8 million from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the result of higher average balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates in fiscal 2007 when compared to fiscal 2006. Interest income increased from $11.4 million to $20.7 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the result of higher average balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates in fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005. Other Income (Expense), net Other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities. There were no significant changes in other income from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. However, other income decreased by $1.1 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the liquidation of marketable securities during fiscal 2006 in order to obtain the cash needed for the repatriation of certain foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Income Taxes     We recognized income tax expense of $46.4 million, $55.6 million and $18.4 million during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes, or our annual effective tax rate, was 9.4% in fiscal 2007, 15.6% in fiscal 2006, and 17.2% in fiscal 2005. The difference in the effective tax rates amongst the three years was primarily a result of changes in our geographic mix of income subject to tax, with the additional change in mix in fiscal 2007 due to certain stock-based compensation expensed for financial accounting purposes under SFAS No. 123(R) and an increase in the research tax credit benefit in fiscal 2007.  Please refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the components of our income tax expense.     44  Liquidity and Capital Resources    | As of January 28, 2007 | | As of January 29, 2006 | ------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+---------+----------------------------------------+-- | (In millions) | Cash and cash equivalents | $ | 544.4 | | $ | 551.8Marketable securities | | 573.4 | | | 398.4Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities | $ | 1,117.8 | | $ | 950.2 | Year Ended | --------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------+------- | January 28, | | January 29, | | January 30, |  | 2007 | | 2006 | | 2005 |  | (in millions) | Net cash provided by operating activities | $ | 587.1 | | $ | 446.4 | | $ | 132.2 | Net cash used in investing activities | | (540.8 | ) | | (41.8 | ) | | (152.0 | )Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities | | (53.6 | ) | | (61.4 | ) | | 13.8 | As of January 28, 2007, we had $1.12 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $167.6 million from the end of fiscal 2006. Our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed by several financial institutions. Our investment policy requires the purchase of top-tier investment grade securities, the diversification of asset type and certain limits on our portfolio duration.   Operating activities generated cash of $587.1 million, $446.4 million, and $132.2 million during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The annual cash provided by operating activities in amounts greater than net income is due primarily to non-cash charges to earnings and the tax benefit on the exercise of stock options. Non-cash charges to earnings included stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization on our long-term assets. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in fiscal 2007, non-cash charges to earnings included $116.7 million of stock-based compensation expense and related deferred income tax impact. The increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily related to the $212.6 million increase in net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities. On our consolidated balance sheet, accrued liabilities increased $77.2 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the recording of income taxes payable for fiscal 2006, the increase in accruals related to customer programs and the recording of $30.6 million in relation to 3dfx, of which $25.0 million was recorded as an adjustment to goodwill. Accounts payable decreased $58.8 million and inventories decreased $60.9 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of significant reductions in older products, offset by an increase in new products. Accounts receivable increased $21.9 million primarily due to increased sales and improved linearity of sales, and cash collections during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases and sales of marketable securities, acquisition of businesses and purchases of property and equipment, which include leasehold improvements for our facilities, and intangible assets. Investing activities used cash of $540.8 million, $41.8 million and $152.0 million during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2007 was primarily due to $401.8 million of cash used for our acquisitions of PortalPlayer, ULi and Hybrid Graphics during the fiscal year. Additionally, net cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures of $145.3 million attributable to purchases of new research and development equipment, hardware equipment, technology licenses, software, intangible assets and leasehold improvements at our various facilities. These uses of cash were offset by $6.2 million of net proceeds from sales of marketable securities. Net cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2006 was primarily due to $79.6 million for capital expenditures primarily attributable to purchases of new research and development equipment, hardware equipment, technology licenses, software, intangible assets and leasehold improvements at our headquarters facility in Santa Clara, California and at our international sites. In addition, we used cash of $12.1 million for our acquisition of a private company and $9.7 million for the investments we made during fiscal 2006 in non-affiliated companies. These uses of cash were offset by $59.6 million of net proceeds from sales of marketable securities. Net cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2005 was primarily due to $84.7 million of net purchases of marketable securities. In addition, we used $67.3 million for capital expenditures primarily attributable to purchases of leasehold improvements for our new data center at our headquarters campus, new research and development emulation equipment, technology licenses, software and intangible assets. We expect to spend approximately $120 million to $140 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2008, primarily for purchases of software licenses, emulation equipment, computers and engineering workstations. In addition, we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets.      45   Financing activities used cash of $53.6 million, $61.4 million and provided cash of $13.8 million during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. Net cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to $275.0 million paid towards our stock repurchase program, offset by cash proceeds of $221.2 million from common stock issued under employee stock plans. Cash used in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from $188.5 million related to our stock repurchase program, offset by $127.5 million of common stock issued under employee stock plans. Stock Repurchase Program On August 9, 2004 we announced that our Board had authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of our common stock, subject to certain specifications, up to an aggregate maximum amount of $300 million. Subsequently, on March 6, 2006, we announced that our Board had approved a $400 million increase to the original stock repurchase program. As a result of this increase, the amount of common stock the Board has authorized to be repurchased has now been increased to a total of $700 million. The repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured stock repurchase programs, in compliance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, Rule 10b-18, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.As part of our share repurchase program, we have entered into and we may continue to enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions. These agreements generally require that we make an up-front payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement, and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock, within a pre-determined range, at the end of the term of the agreement. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 10.3 million shares of our common stock for $275.0 million under structured share repurchase transactions, which we recorded on the trade date of the transaction. Through the end of fiscal 2007, we have repurchased 27.3 million shares under our stock repurchase program for a total cost of $488.1 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we entered into a structured share repurchase transaction to repurchase shares of our common stock for $125.0 million that we expect to settle prior to the end of our first fiscal quarter.Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure RequirementsWe believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then-current stockholders. We also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures, which could harm our business. Factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and, as a result, our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include:    · decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and/or our customers’ products;      · inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next-generation products;     · competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices; and     · new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors. For additional factors see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Operations - Our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.” 3dfx Asset Purchase On December 15, 2000, NVIDIA Corporation and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an agreement, which closed on April 18, 2001, to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the cash consideration due at the closing was $70.0 million, less $15.0 million that was loaned to 3dfx pursuant to a Credit Agreement dated December 15, 2000. The Asset Purchase Agreement also provided, subject to the other provisions thereof, that if 3dfx properly certified that all its debts and other liabilities had been provided for, then we would have been obligated to pay 3dfx two million shares of NVIDIA common stock. If 3dfx could not make such a certification, but instead properly certified that its debts and liabilities could be satisfied for less than $25.0 million, then 3dfx could have elected to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and a reduced number of shares of our common stock, with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by $25.00 per share. If 3dfx could not certify that all of its debts and liabilities had been provided for, or could not be satisfied, for less than $25.0 million, we would not be obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets.      46  In October 2002, 3dfx filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. In March 2003, we were served with a complaint filed by the Trustee appointed by the Bankruptcy Court which sought, among other things, payments from us as additional purchase price related to our purchase of certain assets of 3dfx. In early November 2005, after many months of mediation, NVIDIA and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, or the Creditors’ Committee, reached a conditional settlement of the Trustee’s claims against NVIDIA. This conditional settlement, presented as the centerpiece of a proposed Plan of Liquidation in the bankruptcy case, was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the Bankruptcy Court after notice and hearing. The Trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement, which would have called for a payment by NVIDIA of approximately $30.6 million to the 3dfx estate. Under the settlement, $5.6 million related to various administrative expenses and Trustee fees, and $25.0 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx. Accordingly, during the three month period ended October 30, 2005, we recorded $5.6 million as a charge to settlement costs and $25.0 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx. However, the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation process. On December 21, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court determined that it would schedule trial of one portion of the Trustee’s case against NVIDIA. On January 2, 2007, NVIDIA exercised its right to terminate the settlement agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward confirmation of the Creditors’ Committee’s plan. Beginning on March 21, 2007, NVIDIA and the Trustee are scheduled to try the question of the value of the assets 3dfx conveyed to NVIDIA and, in particular, whether the price NVIDIA paid for those assets was reasonably equivalent to the value of the assets 3dfx sold to NVIDIA.

Our commitment for future license payments under this arrangement could range from $97.0 million to $110.0 million over a ten year period; however, the net outlay under this arrangement may be reduced by the occurrence of certain events covered by the arrangement. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of January 28, 2007, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K 303(a)(4)(ii).Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Interpretation No. 48, or FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN 48 applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to FASB Statement 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under FIN 48 a company would recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. FIN 48 clarifies how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized, provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits, and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 also addresses when a company should record interest and penalties related to tax positions and how the interest and penalties may be classified within the financial statements.  Any differences between tax liability amounts recognized in the statements of operations as a result of adoption of FIN 48 would be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The provisions of FIN 48 will be effective as of first quarter of fiscal 2008. We believe that the cumulative effect of adoption of FIN 48 will not result in any material change to the beginning balance of our retained earnings.     47  In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, or SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The changes to current practice resulting from the application of this Statement relate to the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. We are required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 157 beginning with our fiscal quarter ending April 29, 2007. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, or SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. We adopted the provisions of SAB No. 108 in our fiscal year 2007. The adoption of SAB No. 108 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, or SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The standard requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings. We are required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 159 beginning with our fiscal quarter ending April 27, 2008, although earlier adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 159 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows."
